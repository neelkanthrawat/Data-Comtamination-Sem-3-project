Right now I have to connect and then do a cmd+K in the finder to connect to the AFP share. It'd be nice if it would connect automatically.
The share doesn't have a password (TimeCapsule without any passwords, and no, not using it for backup, we use it for a fileserver).

A: 1.
Edit the file /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/client.up.osx.sh and add these"|"commands at the end of the file, just before exit 0 :
su USERNAME -c '
mkdir /Volumes/TimeCapsule
mount_afp afp://afp_username@server/volumename /Volumes/TimeCapsule
'
open /Volumes/TimeCapsule

Replace USERNAME with your username on the system.
2.
Then add the following at the end of /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/client.down.osx.sh :
umount /Volumes/TimeCapsule

3.
Do not forget to check the set nameserver option for your configuration : 

Warning : Configuration files client.(up|down).osx.sh are executed for every connections made using OpenVPN.
This could also be made using launchd for watching if the vpn connection is up, but I don't know how to use launchd.

A: I have just succeeded to auto-mount NFS after having connected VPN and auto-unmount before discconect with Tunnelblick (3.7.3 on macOS High Sierra).
At first, I had the same problem with Cameron Conner. Still, Studer's answer was quite helpful for me.
Instead of Studer's client.(up|down).osx.sh, I placed two lines in the .ovpn:
up (path to your connected.sh)
down (path to your pre-disconnect.sh)

Then create and edit these connected.sh and pre-disconnect.sh.
connected.sh:
#!/bin/sh
sudo mkdir /Volumes/NFS
sudo mount -P 192.168.0.1:/share /Volumes/NFS

pre-disconnect.sh:
#!/bin/sh
sudo umount /Volumes/NFS

I don't know about TimeCapsule manipulation. So above process is about NFS. I think you can arrange it for TimeCapsule.
I think the point Cameron and I got stucked was su or sudo. And, to avoid password is another problem. My solution to that was sudoers.
Edit /etc/sudores with visudo. Modify the %admin entry from:
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

to:
%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Unless your account is not an admin, it should work."|"lines at the end of the file:

3||"Q: What do I need to do to sell my iPhone 3GS? I've upgraded my iPhone 3GS to iPhone 4 (and my wife's as well). The new phones came with their own US/AT&T microSIM cards and have been activated. So we still have our old phones with the old SIM cards in them. I've deleted the data off of the old phones, and I would like to sell them.
What do I need to do to sell the old phones? Do I remove the SIM from the phone and expect the buyer to put their own SIM in there? How do they go about getting a legit SIM from AT&T to put"|"in the phone? Or do they use the SIM that is in there? How can I be assured the old phones cannot be linked to my current account in any way?

A: One easy option, if you can use the store credit, is to sell them to Radio Shack for $200 [1].
If you prefer cold hard cash, or think you can do better than $200, there's a market for them on eBay, and it's easy to search for the going rate.  The phones will be easier to sell for more if you can jailbreak and/or unlock them in advance.  (How to do that is best left for another question.)
As for how a conscientious buyer activates your old phone through the proper channels, it's my understanding that once you've upgraded your line, your old phone can simply be brought into any AT&T store and associated with a new account.  I.e., you can & should sell the phone without a SIM.
Once it's been wiped and no longer has your SIM, the phone is no longer linked to you.

A: Gazelle.com specializes in buying and reselling or recycling old gadgets. They pledge to completely remove any user data.

A: Technically, once you get a new SIM, the old one is deactivated and no longer associated with your account, so you don't have to bother taking it out. I still would, just to be safe though.

The previous day I had purchased an app with no issues, and this time was told that my payment method was invalid. When I clicked 'Continue' to fix my information, everything was correct so I re-inputted my credit card security code and tapped done. No, fail, declined.
I called my bank as I am currently vacationing in Ireland, and if my debit card (the card my iTunes account uses) starts getting declined I will have issues. No, no problems, they had a note in my account that I was traveling, and there are no holds or flags on my spending. She also noted that the iTunes store had requested a verification of $0.99 but had not charged the card for the amount.
I returned to the iTunes store on my iPhone and attempted again to input my credit card information. Still declined. I entered a second credit card. Declined. I opened up iTunes on my laptop (OS X 10.6, iTunes 10) and checked my account information"|"there. No prompt about it being incorrect when I log in, unlike on the iPhone which tells me – even for free apps – that my payment method was declined as soon as I input my password.
I attempted to purchase the app from the store on my computer and sync it to the iPhone. As soon as I click on purchase, I am asked to authenticate. As soon as I authenticate, I am asked to fix my credit card information. As soon as I fix my credit card information, I am returned to the screen I was at previously where I elected to purchase this app (in this case, that screen is the home page of the App Store).
Two different cards, no issues with the bank, no way to get it working in iTunes proper on the desktop or through various attempts in the App Store in the iPhone. Any ideas? Any suggestions?

A: I actually had this issue before too. I am not sure what caused it, but after waiting a couple of days, it worked again. Here are people discussing it on the Apple Support Forums, but there doesn't appear to be a resolution. I think mine may have been a transient service issue or something. It never happened again after this. 

A: The ""official"" way to fix, per Apple, it is to email Apple's iTunes support (iTunesStoreSupport@apple.com), inform them of the problem, and then wait for them to fix it for you on their end. The good news about this solution is that my email was answered very quickly, the support person knew what the issue was and how to fix it, and within a couple days of telling them about the problem they had fixed it and I am up and working again.
After they told me it was fixed, it did take almost exactly 24 hours to take effect, and in the email they told me ""wait about 24 hours and try purchasing an app again.""
At the time I was having this problem (while traveling abroad) I was in no mood to ""wait it out"" as other answers have suggested, but since it was handled so capably and promptly by iTunes Support, I wouldn't suggest that as a course of action. It is a known issue for them.

A: THIS WORKED FOR ME
I spoke with my credit card company, they mentioned the name had to match EXACTLY as on your card, INCLUDING BEING IN CAPS.  Because there is no place for middle name, add it after first name in the app store credit card info, for example First Name: JOHN C Last Name: SMITH.  Once I did this, it worked.
Good Luck!

A: I keep getting this problem with Itunes and this is the way I solved it without contacting Apple. 
1. Make sure you have funds on your dedicated card
2. Check details with the bank and inform them of any details that cannot be entered correctly into itunes ie Title Itunes lists Ms, Mrs and Mr but not Miss. 
3. Take off all payment information on Itunes sign out of your account and close Itunes and leave it for about an hour and then re-enter the details.
This works for me but I cannot guarnetee if it will work for anyone else.

A: i solved it by logging out of Store in my iPad. Then re-login. At that point, it prompted me to check the payment details. I did the necessary and its gone.

A: No, this will not work. You can have multiple versions of OS X on one machine, but you can only install newer versions than the one that came pre-installed. For example, if your machine came with 10.6.4, you can't run 10.6.3 or older.
When Apple releases new hardware, the drivers for that hardware get rolled into a special build of OS X that comes only on that model. They don't get added to OS X in general until the next point release. (That means that drivers for the hypothetical machine I'm talking about wouldn't be added until 10.6.5.)
Apple doesn't release drivers as standalone software, which effectively makes it impossible to install and older version of OS X than what your Mac shipped with. You'll find that if you put the install disc for an older version in the drive, it either won't boot or it will refuse to install.
However, you can go the other direction. If you have an old Mac running 10.5, you can use Disk Utility to make another partition (HFS+ Journaled), then boot the install DVD for 10.6 and install it to that partition. To switch between the two after installing, hold alt when you boot up. (You can also select the default boot partition through the Startup Drive pane in System Preferences within either OS X install.) Boot camp is not required for this. Boot camp is only required for installing non-Apple operating systems like Windows and Linux.

A: I would think partitioning the disk and using Boot Camp is all you need to do here.
If you don't have a 10.5 disk already, then you'll need to go through Ebay and sites of its ilk.

A: Boot Camp"|"doesn't require you to reformat your drive. HFS+ partitions can be live-resized by the Boot Camp Assistant or the Disk Utility without going through the trouble of erasing everything. No file on your Mac OS partition will be affected.

In this case, you will need to defragment your drive, in order to put all your files in a nice contiguous space on your hard drive, so that all the remaining space is contiguous too and a partition can be made there. As far as I know, iDefrag can do this for about $15. (Disclaimer: I never did it and can't guarantee it will work. But it should. Can someone confirm?)

I'm not going to ask you whether you think it is, as that is clearly a subjective question. What I will ask instead is how does it compare to normal video calling. Is there anything new that hasn't been done before?

A: Entirely new? No - not really, but the quality is quite acceptable (I'd say it's better than most Skype video calls I've had) and it's extremely painless to use. It's also at the present time far more limited in audience (only iPhone 4's, iPad 2's and Macs) than normal"|"video calling.
You can think of it as video calling built right into the OS with software that doesn't require hoops (no log in required) to jump through to use it.

A: As for your question, Is there anything new that hasn't been done before, then one could be generous and say that the no-account-required and it-just-works is quite nice, as is the elegant use of front or rear cameras and the ability to switch between them, and the automatic landscape/portrait modes. That's quite slick. But it's not a competition-killer.
On the whole, Facetime is the typical Apple feature -- very polished, but a limited feature-set, and only available to users on the exact same platform (in this case, only iPhone 4's, iPad 2's and Macs). That alone limits the usefulness of the app quite a bit.
For general-purpose video calling, there are general-purpose apps like Skype which do it better, and which even work over 3G (if you're lucky), and which aren't limited to specific Apple-only devices.
I'd recommend Skype over Facetime any day.
(Notice I didn't comment on the revolutionary issue either.)

A: You're obviously well aware of the long history of video calling implementations to ask this question, so  


*

*Having an idea is trivially easy.

*Implementing it well is hard.

*Implementing it so you don't get
sued is even harder.

*Driving substantial user growth or taking over user share in adopting your implementation is the ultimate challenge.


Apple's hype and I would presume most non-hater's hope is that they are shooting for no less than #4 above. If you consider implementation and support costs of a video chat system as well as voice and picture quality, it's hard to say anyone is beating them at #2 either.

On the PC keyboard, the CTRL key is in the bottom left corner of the keyboard. So, it's very easy to hold it with your pinky, while keeping your hand in its normal position, so you can easily press the other key required for the shortcut (e.g., A, C, V, etc).
On a Mac, the ""equivalent"" key to CTRL is Command. However, I can't easily reach that key with any finger - especially without moving my hand from its normal position - so, I can't easily press Command-C or Command-V without really focusing on it.
Is this just a result of years of practicing on a PC? What finger do Mac users use to click the command key when executing a shortcut?

A: When I first made the switch to Mac I used System Preferences -> Keyboard to switch the ⌘ key with ^ (control) key. That worked for a while until I became"|"more comfortable with the basic two-key commands. Once I started using more complex three and four key commands I had to put it back to default because I needed the labels on the keys at first to remember what the symbols <-> key mappings were.

A: I mostly use my thumb. If I'm trying to hit a key that's more in the middle or right side of the keyboard (such as C or V), I use my ring finger.
Note that I'm a horrible typist, so I never use the right ⌘ key. If you're comfortable using that, you can probably just use your thumbs.

A: You can use either thumb to hold down a ⌘ key and then use another finger to access the other key. You just have to get used to sliding either thumb a little to the left or to the right of the space bar.
Yes, this is just a result of years of using a PC.

A: It's easier to type shortcuts if you use Sticky Keys as well. This way you can type shortcuts one key at a time, which might sound slower, but isn't if it means you can keep your hands in position and your eyes on the screen. 
I tend to use my thumb for command. I use my left pinky for control, shift and Fn, although it may be different for others as I keep my pinkies over the row below the home row. Alt is tricky, but I guess the pinky makes the most sense for me personally, usually.
There's nothing wrong in using different fingers at different times. For instance on the rare occasion I want to show the Dock (⌃⌥⌘F) I move my arm and use index on cmd, middle on alt and ring on control, then type the D afterwards.

A: I also thought it was inconvenient at start but later realised how good it is with the command button. I learnt to type on a keyboard with no markings which requires you to have all keys memorised and your fingers on the right position on the keyboard. By using the command button with your thumb (which is regularly only used for the space ), your fingers are always positioned correctly on the keyboard. Using the control button, you HAVE to use your pinky finger which makes your fingers leave the correct position, which in the end makes you look at the keyboard!
(by correct position i mean, pinky on A, ring finger on S, middle finger on D, long finger on F etc.)

A: Here is the official advice from Apple
On page 67, they state the following:

Use a light touch when typing or using the trackpad and keep your hands and fingers relaxed. Avoid rolling your thumbs under your palms.

Based on this, it would be my assumption that they intend you to either move your entire hand and use your thumb or pointer finger. If you find this unnatural, you can always change the control key to perform the duty of the command key. Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys, and change the buttons around as you see fit.



A: Very late reply but just giving my 2 cents as a long time Apple Magic Keyboard user who's been using a more standard keyboard layout for around 4 months.
Note: This only applies to the official Apple keyboards like the Magic Keyboard.
I have to disagree with some of the comments on the accepted answer which say to avoid using the thumb. Due to the Apple keyboards having a much smaller spacebar than the average PC keyboard layout, the thumb movement required to reach the Command key is very minimal. So minimal in fact, that the thumb knuckle is usually the only joint that requires movement and the amount of movement is generally within the natural range of the thumb. In other words, it's a very comfortable movement. That's at least how I feel and I have generally medium-small hands.
If however, you're using a non-Apple keyboard with a larger spacebar, yes, it's not advisable to use your thumbs for command as the additional movement required could cause you problems in the long run."|accustomed to the Mac layout and started using the ⌃ key for ctrl-c and ctrl-v. I can confirm that most people use their middle finger to press the command key.|0.3498777151107788|0.04563758389261744
12||"Q: Upgrade time machine storage? I'm going to buy 2T external HDD to replace my already full 1T HDD external. I want to keep the time machine backup data. In this case, is it just OK to copy all the time machine backup data in 1T HDD to 2T HDD? 

A: I know this might be old, but here are the right steps to perform a Time Machine hard drive replacement preserving old backups, without having to use CCC or SuperDuper! (which I love, but are not needed). 
I have a Mac Pro so to make things more complicated I added Two drives and created a RAID-1 (Mirror); once the mirror was working, I proceeded with these steps (sans the “plug drive”) ;)
The above comment is to demonstrate that the volume composition doesn’t affect this. 
Like with any other Hard Drive operation, always make sure you have a backup or a way to restore your information in case something goes wrong. Read before you click “ok”. Use common sense and be careful. 
You need to be familiar with Disk Utility (located in /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app). It’s a very simple and straightforward application, but also very dangerous if you go coo coo and start clicking things without reading.
TIME MACHINE HARD DRIVE MIGRATION TO A NEW DRIVE PRESERVING BACKUP HISTORY


*

*Plug your new (presumably bigger) drive. Using Disk Utility, create the HFS+ Journaled partition (make sure you use GUID to avoid problems). Give it a name like: NewTM"|"(you can change that later). (This may be obvious but if you have a Mac Pro, turn it off before inserting the drives…) 

*Open the Time Machine configuration and turn off Time Machine. 

*Unmount the Time Machine drive (the ‘old’) and mount it again. This causes the drive to be mounted as a regular drive and not have the “Time Machine” Green Icon. (This is important). You can do that from Disk Utility. 

*Now go back to Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app) and click on the restore tab. 

*You will see two boxes to type, but you can also drag and drop, so drag the “TimeMachine” (old) to the source box (the upper one).

*Drag the new “NewTM” partition to the target box (lower one). 

*IMPORTANT: select “Erase Destination” so there’s a block level copy.

*Click restore and make sure that you have the right partitions (i.e.: read what you are being shown in the popup, it’s your last chance or you could erase your data.) When you’re satisfied, click ok to the popup and go cook. My 750gb took over four hours (and it was a SATA drive). Consider that USB drives (and even Firewire 800) are slower than any SATA internal drive. Some people reports this to take over five hours over USB for much smaller drives, so be patient.
Here’s how mine looked:



If everything went right, you should see two identical drives on your desktop, that is because the old drive was “fully duplicated” in the new one. The difference should be the free space, the new one should have more (if you are using a larger drive of course).
We’re almost done, but we need to activate Time Machine again. 


*Unmount the old Time Machine drive. If you are unsure which one it is, check the free space and/or physically disconnect it; don’t worry, you’ll be able to use it again soon.

*Open the TimeMachine configuration screen again and press Change Drive. Select the new one (should be the only one called Time Machine). The disk should now turn “green” with the Time Machine icon. Congratulations, you’ve migrated your Time Machine. 


What now?
Test it. Use Time machine to see if your files are there, recover some old files to see if they come, make sure everything is ok, you can reconnect your old drive and format it, or use it for furniture if you want. 
If you previously had Spotlight configured to exclude your Time Machine, you might want to make sure that everything is ok. Maybe you’ll have to drag the Time Machine drive again. Just check it. 
And that’s all. I hope you don’t destroy your data in the process. I came up with these steps by googling, experimenting and using common sense :) Hope it helps. 

A: I did some searching and found this (the caveat being that this applies to 10.5):

Using the Restore feature in Disk Utility, you can ""restore"" the Time Machine disk to another disk and retain the history of changes. This could be useful if you've outgrown your Time Machine backup drive, and want to migrate your existing backups to a new, larger drive. You should turn Time Machine off before doing starting this process, of course.
Be aware that the disks will have the same name and information, so it might confuse Time Machine. For example, after I activated Time Machine on the newly-created disk, I plugged in the old disk, and it showed up as a Time Machine drive, but the backup failed. It's probably best to avoid having both of them plugged in. At the very least, rename one of them.
Perhaps more importantly, Carbon Copy Cloner 2.3 doesn't work correctly for cloning a Time Machine drive (I don't know about 3.x), as it doesn't copy hard links but rather, copies what the links point to. This results in a lot of copies of your system when the Time Machine database has been around for a while.

The common suggestion from that thread is for CCC is to a block-to-block copy of the old disk to the new disk.

A: SuperDuper! works fine for me. I just changed my Time Machine disk last week and history is still there.

A: I think if you do 2 below steps can do it: 


*

*Turn Time Machine off before copy all time machine back up data to new HDD.

*Your new disk should have the same name(information) of old disk.

14||"Q: Where can I get install discs for OS X 10.5 to max out a Powerbook G4? Over the past year, my dad's Powerbook G4 (OS X 10.3) lost the ability to run any usable version of firefox or other end of life PPC software. Apple customer service wouldn't sell him a copy of 10.5 and told him to search ebay for copies of OS X 10.5, 8 months after releasing 10.6. We've been watching ebay and the price just keeps climbing above the original price.
I told him to buy a copy of 10.6 and the license should allow for installing older versions. He took it to a 3rd party Mac dealer and they said they couldn't install 10.5 if he doesn't own a 10.5"|"license (which no one will sell anymore). Does the OS 10.6 license cover older versions of OS X? Can 10.5 be obtained for the original price anywhere?

A: Firstly, I'm not sure where you heard that 10.6 shipped less than six months ago. It actually shipped in August 2009, making it over 12 months old.
Old system software tends to sell at a premium. I'm not sure why, but it may be at least partially because Apple no longer produces them. However, as Apple only sells 10.6 as a stand-alone OS (that is, it doesn't sell upgrade versions, just full) you can legitimately buy 10.5 from anyone with a copy who has since upgraded to 10.6.
There are plenty of places to buy 10.5 if you're willing to shop around. Keep an eye on this search and this search and see what turns up. For instance, this eBay sale is currently going for $40.

A: No the 10.6 license doesn't cover 10.5, and no, you won't find it anywhere for the original price.
I'm assuming his powerbook is running 10.4?  To be perfectly honest, 10.5 runs like crap on a G4.  I have a 1.67 PBG4 and firefox runs so slow that it's unusable.  Take a look at the PPC optimized builds of firefox at http://firefoxmac.furbism.com/.  Or try Opera, it's been much better for me.
Stick with 10.4, 10.5 will slow him down even worse!
edit
Since apparently I can't read, this answer may not have much relevance.  However, I'd still advise against moving up to 10.5.  If you can get your hands on 10.4, I think that would be the way to go.  Firefox and most other apps are still supporting 10.4.

A: So Apple will actually sell you a copy of OS X 10.5, Leopard, for $130 through 1-800-MY-Apple. They just tell you to look at eBay first, and will push back a few times before relenting and offering to sell you the upgrade.
Not everyone you talk to at Apple may know this, so you may have to talk to more than one rep.

Where should I look for low cost Intel Macs that fit my needs? In general, I don't think refurbished Macs from Apple are low cost.

A: How do you feel about a used machine? A one or two year old Mac Pro tower is still a very nice machine for video editing, and you could likely find one on eBay for a fraction of the cost of a brand new one.

A: For a while now I've felt that the best 'bang for buck' that Apple sell is the iMac range. 
The laptops are wondrous machines but they are expensive and they do top-out in terms of"|"performance at a certain point, and connectivity to other devices can become limited. The Mac Pro/towers are fabulous (I used to have a dual 2.5 G5) but you do pay a lot for that expandability and engineering - a quick look on eBay will show you that both the laptops and the towers can still command near-new prices, especially as Apple owners will often tend to get Applecare, keep the original packaging and use Apple-approved type parts and upgrades.
The Mac Mini unfortunately has increased in price as the spec has improved and I now think it's quite an expensive way to get a Mac.
A second hand Intel iMac, or even a low-end brand new one, gives a good mix of reasonable CPU, upgradeable memory (to a point), plenty of scope for FW800, FW400 and USB external connections as well as a potential internal hard drive upgrade if you get really desperate. It will happily drive an external monitor, something that in my experience people new to Mac don't realise (they think that it's all about the built-in screen and nothing else). 
It's obviously more of a commodity machine than the towers and that's reflected in the price - you can get an awful lot of iMac for the same kind of price as the entry-level laptop. And if you can find a second-hand or factory-refurbed model, even better!

A: Prices and availability on refurbished Macs directly from Apple vary from day to day (and sometimes hour to hour), and you can often get exceptionally good deals there. For instance, they've currently got a mini for 26% off ($589 versus $799). Yes, some days, there's nothing worth mentioning—but the following day, there might be, so it's worth checking back.
The best part of buying Apple refurbs, of course, is that they come with the same full warranty as Apple's brand-new hardware.
[Whoops, looks like the mini sold out while I was writing this, which kinda proves my point…]

A: Best way to get cheap Macs is from schools that are getting rid of old hardware. Granted most of that hardware is crap.
If you're near local schools (or cough eBay) take a gander through anything the photography classes are getting rid of. 
Also checkout refurbished computers directly from Apple. You mentioned that you don't find these low cost, but 15-20% off (in most cases) is pretty decent.
In terms of new computers, I would recommend one of the Mac Mini. It's a stout little machine, and doesn't tie you into a particular monitor."|"performance. 
I think that if you are doing video-editing then the iMac range is a good place to start.

tested and restored to full working order. They are sold with a full one-year warranty and are

21||"Q: How can I embed an image in an Apple Mail signature? I use Apple Mail daily, and up until recently I could have images inside my mail by referencing an external source. However the external source has since become unavailable, so ideally I would like to embed the images into my mail signatures. I am pretty good with creating the signature in HTML and create the webarchive for it, however have no idea where to begin as far as embedding the images are concerned.
Has anyone actually done this, or know of a very good resource that I can"|"use to figure it out?

A: You can simply drag an image file into a signature in Mail.
This will embed the image with in the email so all your future emails will include an attachment.
I sugest using a PNG as they are quite light-weight.

A: *

*Once the Mail program has launched, open the Mail application Preferences. This can be done by selecting it from the Mail menu bar option or by using the ""Command - ,"" keyboard shortcut, which simply consists of pressing ⌘ + , at the same time.

*Choose the ""Signatures"" option of the Mail Preferences window.

*Add a new signature profile by clicking on the ""Create a Signature"" button located under the second pane within the Signatures Preferences window. This button is represented by a square containing a plus (+) sign. See accompanying image.

*In the third pane located within the Mail Signatures Preferences Window, type the text of your email signature. You can also paste your text from another application, like Microsoft Word, Apple Pages or Apple TextEdit. Pasting from another application will maintain the text's font, size and style, if that is something you need or desire. Keep in mind that some fonts may not display properly on the email recipient's computer, depending upon the fonts you use and the fonts they have.

*Assuming that you have an image that you wish to add to your new signature, just drag the image from its location on your Mac (using the Finder) and drop it in the same pane where you just typed or pasted your new signature text. The image should appear next to or below your text. Make sure to use only web compatible images - JPG, PNG or GIF."|follow to get this done?|0.30257484316825867|0.020761245674740483
22||"Q: Is there a better way to travel internationally with an iPhone (3GS/4 specifically)? I've travelled to Europe and Asia quite a bit with iPhones with no problems (I live in the US), except for the fact that making calls anywhere outside the US is crazy expensive and of course I wouldn't dare turn on data roaming for fear of the thousand-dollar bill.
These days, though, is there not a better way? Can I not go into a shop in the UK and buy a pay-as-you-go micro-sim for 30GBP and call/data away? Is my iPhone (3GS and 4) permanently and forever locked to AT&T unless I jailbreak it, even with a different sim card?
I'm willing to jailbreak my 3GS to accomplish this mission, but I'd like to hear from someone with real-world experience before doing so.
Thanks!

A: As you've pointed out, US iPhones are locked to AT&T. Fundamentally, that's your only real issue here. If you can unlock your iPhone, then your suggesting of just picking up a micro-sim and using it for data and calls works"|"perfectly. In the UK, we can buy iPhones unlocked, and get our network operators to unlock them.
What you described is exactly what I've done when travelling abroad, but it's entirely reliant on having an unlocked device to start with. From there, you should be good to go. In the UK, there's a massive range of low-cost, pay as you SIM only options to choose from. O2 do a big range of SIM only deals, including micro-sim plans (see here).
The other option to consider is, if you're looking to upgrade to an iPhone 4 anytime soon, buy it abroad, from the UK, unlocked, and then you won't have to jailbreak it in the future. UK and European iPhone models will work perfectly well in the US, and they come with a global warranty as well.

A: Yes your iPhone is locked on AT&T, you must jailbreak & unlock it if you want to use another sim. If you only travel to UK, you might take a pay-as-you-go sim. If you travel in many country in europe you might be interested by http://www.callineurope.com/. It might even be interesting if you only go to UK has there is a special UK pass.

A: I traveled to South America last summer and just for that trip, signed up to an AT&T International calling plan that included both phone calls and text messaging. I didn't use my phone a lot (in 2 weeks in Peru and Ecuador) so I only spent about $25, but the text messaging turned out to be critical during a two-day medical emergency involving a family member.   I turned the plan off as soon as I got home.  
Recently I went to Asia and just set up the texting plan for $10/month and used it for just one month.  (No phone calls.)
Will something like that work for your for Europe and Asia?  (That is: buy something temporary from US AT&T, focusing just on your upcoming trip, and then shut it off when you get home.)

A: If you are looking for a truly global answer - this article is updated to let you know which carriers allow an authorized unlock.
http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1937
If your phone is locked on a carrier that will unlock it, simply see what the price and procedure is to get it unlocked. Only you and apple will know the status of your phone. If you have a used phone, any service rep can look up your serial number and let you know the status of that device in the iPhone device activation database.
If you can't or won't unlock a locked device - then it's a cat and mouse game to get it unlocked. The details depend on the exact version of iOS software and modem firmware on your phone. If you restore your phone - the unlock can get undone. It's not impossible to do, but it's technically tricky and you'll need to get someone to help you or learn the ropes. Do consider if the phone has a problem on the road - you may need a computer to re-unlock it so be prepared to rent a handset if you don't travel with the tools and knowledge to perform another unlock yourself.
Only you can determine if the hassle factor of unlocking your phone outweighs the price of buying one that is authorized to be unlocked."|"Q: Is there a better way to travel internationally with an iPhone (3GS/4 specifically)?

I used this setup for a couple weeks with no problem at all.  A day or two ago, sometime in the afternoon, it got funny: the connection would work for a few seconds just fine, and then cut out for a few seconds, then come back, etc.  Sometimes I can sit here with my iPod and watch the network status icon at the top of the display come and go.
It's not a strength issue: I'm right next to it, and it always shows max bars in the iPod control panel.  It's not a WEP issue, because it accepts my password, and if I turn off WEP entirely it does the same thing.  If I'm in the iPod control panel, it always shows max signal strength for my network -- it just disconnects me regularly, and frequently.  (This is especially annoying if I go into an app like Safari, because it asks me to pick a network and retype my password every 10 seconds.)  It's not an iPod issue, because the wifi still works perfectly on all other wireless networks I use.
Has anyone seen this before?  I haven't tried rebooting yet because I have a ton of things open.  Is there some way to restart the networking subsystem on Mac OS that might help this?

A: I suggest you restart your box to make sure that it’s just not a problem there. You could technically turn off the AirPort and turn it back on (that’d restart most of the stuff), however the “problem” could be on the Kernel level, which would only be fixed with a proper restart or even a hardware buffer, which a cold shutdown would most likely fix. 
In any case, if you still want to experiment, try changing the Channel from Automatic to something you can use in your country and move it, maybe somebody (neighborhood?) brought new devices or networks next to you and that causes new interference that wasn’t there two days ago."|"Q: Wifi shared from Macbook comes and goes I have a new iPod Touch, and an old(er) Mac.

A: Yeah, it's pretty easy. Open System Preferences, go to Networking, then click the Plus sign under the left bar. Choose the interface, give a name to the adapter configuration you're creating, then press OK. You will have to provide manual configuration of IP address and DNS for the second entry -- DHCP won't work for it, because it shares the same MAC address as the original entry, so the router won't issue it another address.

*

*Library file: /Users/glenn/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library

*Music: /Volumes/MyVolume/Music
But every now and then when I use the laptop somewhere outside my WiFi network, and then come back, fire up iTunes and play a song  I get a library full of those pesky little exclamation point icons next to my songs. This is because iTunes have guessed that ""Oh, he's not at home, let's reset the music files location to /Users/glenn/Music/iTunes."" And there are no music there.
How can I prevent iTunes from doing this ""smart"" guess, and just leave the setting alone?
PS. And MyVolume is auto-mounted on my laptop. But of course, if iTunes is running when opening up the lid of the MacBook, it takes some time for it to mount, and iTunes won't find the path to the music at first.

A: You can make ""iTunes Music"" an alias to your music folder on your network drive. That should keep iTunes' smartness at bay.

A: Finally figured out how to get around this myself. My solution is to have two separate libraries, one local and one on my drive. I created a LaunchAgent (see https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html) that runs a script when the mount path to the disk changes (via WatchPaths). The script checks whether the directory /Volumes/drivename exists, and if it does it sets runs a command to tell iTunes to change to the Library on the drive.
if [ -e ""$mountPath"" ]
then
   defaults write com.apple.iTunes 'alis:1:iTunes"|"Library Location' -data ""drive hex path data""
else
   defaults write com.apple.iTunes 'alis:1:iTunes Library Location' -data ""local hex path data""
fi

Otherwise it runs the same command with the path to the local library.
Mac OS does some weird kind of encoding for the hex data path, so I would recommend holding down the option key while starting iTunes, selecting each library, and examine the plist for the path data (note that when you use the defaults command you have to remove the brackets and spaces from the hex data).
This way, if your drive isn't mounted, iTunes will load a local library and won't mess up your main one. This can be handy for traveling, etc when you just want to use the local library to play stuff on iCloud.

A: Apparently this is a never-ending issue, because by this date I’m running OS 10.13.6 on a 2012 Mac Mini, and I needed Winger’s Answer to figure out a solution for me: not up to coding in the system files. But I DID realize (as he suggested) that if I removed iTunes from the ‘Login Items’ automatic startup list in the Users system Prefs pane, and let the Mac connect to the network drive first (which is an ethernet connected TimeCapsule, which I’m using also for it’s storage volume as extra space, and IS in the Login Items pane), that when iTunes is opened it finds its library right where it left it! Happy iTunes, happy me!

A: What works for me is a combination of the above ... add the shared folder location to:
system preferences -> users & groups -> login items (in the login name you're using)
This establishes the network connection automatically upon restart which appears to be the root cause of this.
Then untick the ""reopen windows when logging back in"" option when restarting. When the mac next restarts and you log in, the shared folder will automatically be opened (it opens in finder, but you can close it).
When you open apple music, it remembers what it was set to and you no longer need to reset the location and rescan your files each time.
I worked this one out because when apple music is opened before the network drive, the music file location reverts back to the default location. But if you close apple music, open the network drive where your music is stored, then re-open apple music it magically reverts back to what you had it set to.
But if you re-enable the ""reopen windows when logging back in"" option, it seems that apple music gets launched before the shared folder - so you're back where you started. Although if you typically have a lot of windows open, you could just close and re-open apple music after restarting which should work.

A: Just a thought for your laptop, why don't you share your iTunes library and stream it to your laptop instead of mounting the network drive?
I'm in the process of setting this up now, I just moved my iTunes library and media files to my Network Attached Storage, which can share with all machines on my home network.
I was having the same library reset issue as you, so I'll try using an alias in Windows 7 to get around this (thanks @zneak). Nothing scarier than telling iTunes where my 10,000+ song library is and have it show nothing :(

A: I would guess that when the iTunes media directory /Volumes/MyVolume/Music is found to not exist, it resets to the default value of /Users/glenn/Music/iTunes. That is to say, I don't think it matters if the files are there or not (so network mounting is not so much the issue), but that the directory is there and can be browsed.
So a solution would be to have an empty directory as your iTunes media library directory (which can just be the default), and mount the network share into that directory. This would involve using smbmount rather than the standard Finder-based /Volumes/... mounting. Of course... smbmount doesn't come with OS X, so this solution will require some effort on your part to get smbmount.
You might be able to achieve the same with symbolic links, though I'm not sure whether iTunes can handle its media library directory being a broken symlink; it might just delete the symlink by forcibly creating the /Users/glenn/Music/iTunes directory on top of it...?

A: The ""music location"" path only matters if you set itunes to ""import media into your local library"" and with ""automatic library management"" activated. With both options disabled, its not of importance. You set the options in the same tab where you set the ""music location"" path.
Remember: If you use links or aliases to non existing places (when youre not at your network) you might get into trouble with itunes trying to write stuff there - it might even reset because of this.
If you add files from a network, with local management off, the network path will be stored inside your library file, no matter what is set as music location. If you are not on your network you will always see the exclamation mark as the files aren't accessible, it makes totally sense. Exclamation mark goes away as soon your network is at reach again.
I have everything stored on my network, nothing locally and do not have any trouble."|"Music: /Volumes/drivename/Music'
fi

This works for me, but I'm not sure how well it would work for others. If anyone has any suggestions for improvements, I'd be happy to hear them."|0.31793349981307983|0.029136316337148808

I'm not attempting to share an internet connection over the ad hoc wifi network, my goal is to be able to control my netbook from my iPhone when I'm on the go and away from other wireless networks.

Previous audio books that I had built had no such issue. They last around 10 hours, which is still more than the time at which the two problematic files stop.

Any thoughts on how to implement criteria in an OR?

A: You've got your rule set up correctly - if it's an ANY set of predicates it's as if there is an OR between them. It may be slow (and why nothing is showing up) because an Entire Message Contains has to search every email you have.
What happens if you have only criteria three and not criteria two - there may be an issue with criteria three that is causing the search to fail. (Check Console)
You can kludge a smart mailbox with AND and OR rules by using other Smart Mailboxes and the ""Message Is In Mailbx"" or ""Message Is Not In Mailbox"" predicate.

A: For the ""Entire Message"" and ""Contains"" combination, you can use AND and OR to add multiple keywords. For example, 
Contains messages that match ALL of the following conditions:
Data Received is in the date range ""01/01/2011"" to ""31/12/2011""
Entire Message Contains ""invoice OR receipt""

Specifically, it's stuck in the ""down"" position, which means I'm selecting pretty much everything all the time (you wouldn't believe how frustrating it was just to ask this question).  It was fine yesterday.  What can I do to unstick it?

A: The trackpad getting stuck is also a well known symptom of a bulging battery in the MacBook Pros of this generation. I'm dealing with this issue myself and am very annoyed about it too, because this 2007 Santa Rosa MBP I paid for is essentially the most lemon computer I've ever owned (at least"|"four other hardware failures besides this one).

A: This is going to sound dumb, but have you restarted the Mac? I've had this issue on my Magic Trackpad a couple of times and the only way I was able to cure it was with a simple restart. (At first I thought it might be because I also ran MagicPrefs, but I've since removed that and the problem still occurs sometimes).
If you find a restart 'fixes' it, as I have done in the past, then it's possible that it's the software getting confused rather than a physical issue. I haven't found a Terminal invocation yet to restart the mouse driver part of the Mac but I reckon that if I found one I could probably use that to unstick the pad when the problem arises.

A: I had the same exact problem and it was almost unbearable to search for help. I took out the battery but kept my MacBook connected to the adaptor and, go figure, it works like a charm. Time for a new battery! The bulging on my battery is very noticeable. 

A: In most models there's a screw directly beneath the trackpad that influences how hard/soft the click should be. If you have the right tools to open it up, you could try turning it a bit to see what happens.
What you can try first is to press down on the button, hold it down, move your finger from left to right a few times and then let it go again. Sometimes this fixes it, but if somethings really broken or worn it probably won't work.

A: I've had an iBook g4 that had this ""Issue""... it turned out a cookie crumble got stuck in the space between trackpad and case (don't ask). Clicking a few times on different places on the trackpad and some canned air fixed it. Might be worth a try before you pop out the screwdrivers.

A: This means your battery is at the end of its life. This happens to all batteries, sooner or later, depending on your type of usage and most importantly on the amount of cycles (i.e."|"full recharges).
Your battery will probably not last longer than one hour at this stage. You can of course try to train it by letting it drain the battery until the MacBook sleeps and then recharge it up to 100%, leave it recharged for at least a few hours, and then repeat this process a few times. By doing this, you sort of ""reset"" the battery and can get a few minutes more out of it. It helped me get at least 20 minutes more.
If OS X tells you to service battery, it means that you will need to buy a new battery if you want full capacity back. There is no warranty that would cover worn out batteries. I had had the same problem, but unless your battery has less than 200 cycles, this is absolutely normal and you should buy a new battery. Again, Apple will not replace your battery unless it's almost unused.

A: It's most likely because your battery is nearing the end of its useful life.  Your battery has a maximum charge capacity that decreases with age and use.  You can see the current capacity in Utilities --> System Profiler --> Hardware --> Power --> Full charge capacity (mAh):.
However, this doesn't tell you what your original Full charge capacity was.  For this, you either need to look up the specs of your laptop, or use a utility like CoconutBattery."|"Q: Battery warning ''Service battery"" Battery warning ""Service battery"". This warning have appeared in my MacBook Pro (2008) with Snow Leopard. Is there a way to find out what a reason of this warning, without apply to service centre?

A: The most common reason for this warning is that your battery is at the end of its life. This is most likely the case if you have been using your computer for a long time and have had to replace your battery several times. However, there are other reasons for this warning, such as if you have left a light on overnight or if you have left your computer plugged in when it was not in use.
If you want to find out what is causing the warning, you can try to diagnose the problem by running some tests. You can also contact Apple support to see if they can help you. If you are unable to fix the problem, you may need to take your computer to a service center for repairs."|0.31508755683898926|0.16176470588235295

That is why several 500Gb drives did not fit MBP's and the one you are mentioning will never fit your laptop.

Currently, the max capacity on a 9.5mm Hard Drive is 750Gb (WD Scorpio Blue 5400rpm), and SSD is 480Gb (OWC SSD Extreme Pro) --> I bought mine here but 240Gb, it's superb!
to learn how to swap them (unibody, late 2008 models), see this OWC video and if you want to check the performance from an SSD and a HHD, please check this video.
my own SSD:


A: If the new drive is also 7200 rpm, what you’re going to get is usually a faster drive, more modern with (possibly) more internal cache which could lead to a slight improvement. In any case, the difference between 7200 and 5400 rpm is not that much. There is a difference and you will notice it in certain things, but there are other factors that will affect performance way before the disk in a day to day usage. Unless all you do is write/read files from the disk, get the bigger disk you can afford. Of course you can always get a 2TB external FW drive and store all the junk there, while still having plenty of room in the internal drive. 
Or you could get a smaller 128/256 SSD super faster drive and store most of your stuff in your external 500rpm drive (in a USB External Enclosure for 10 bucks), but leaving your OS in the internal super fast SSD.
Options… options… :)
In any case, always get as much ram as you can afford."|"Q: Performance hit of installing a new hard drive in a MacBook Pro I have a MacBook Pro 5,3 with a 7200 rpm 500 GB hard drive.

I need to replace my aging ADSL modem/router, and am considering the Netgear DGN3500 or Linksys WAG320N, as they both appear to have all the features I require (802.11n, ADSL2, Gigabit ethanet). I recently purchased a Belkin Share which also had all these features, but I had to return it as it didn't support Bonjour, meaning my iMac and Macbook Pro were not playing nicely on my LAN.
Does anyone here have experience with the above modem/routers, and can tell me whether they will work well in a LAN consisting of OSX and Windows based machines? I also have"|"a variety of wireless devices (iPod Touch 2nd Gen, iPhone 4, PS3, PSP) that will need to integrate into the network.

A: I had a Linksys very similar to that one and many other modem/routers (in fact a few days ago I had to get a new one and found a DLink) and never had any problem with Bonjour “not working” or being unsupported. What do you mean by “didn’t support Bonjour”? Bonjour is a local protocol and unless you have different subnets within the same place and have a bridge/router in-between them, Bonjour is just like any other protocol inside your internal network.
I’m sure that either the Netgear or the Linksys are going to do the job fine. We have Window XP, Windows 7, OS X and Linux in our network. 
If you expand your question to indicate what is your Bonjour’s problem maybe we can help. 

A: I purchased the Netgear DGN3500, and so far so good. While its setup software only runs on Windows, its browser based interface has a setup wizard that does simplify configuration somewhat. 
On the LAN side of things, everything appears to be working as expected, with no special config required. I am able to successfully resolve IP addresses via machine name, and AFP appears to be working. Other Bonjour driven features such as printer sharing and shared iTunes libraries also work. These are all things the Belkin Share wouldn't do (which is ironic, considering it DID come bundled with Mac software).
Network performance is excellent, and is a definite improvement over the 10/100 LAN connection of my old modem/router.
In summary, this appears to be the Mac friendly modem/router I was looking for.

A: I can confirm that the Belkin Share, Surf and Play routers do not support the Bonjour service, I have an email from Belkin support to that effect. The impression I got was that there was a hidden firewall that was suppressing the Bonjour multicasts between computers."|"Q: Anyone have experience with the Netgear DGN3500 or Linksys WAG320N?

Instructions

Requirements


*

*Soundflower – free download from Google Code (more recent version here)

*AU Lab – free download from Apple Developers (requires free Apple Dev ID)

*Download and install both Soundflower and AU Lab, you will then need to restart your Mac to have full access to the audio components. Once rebooted, follow along with the instructions below:
Set Up a Universal Audio Equalizer for Mac OS X


*

*Set System Volume to the maximum level, do this either through the menu bar or by hitting the Volume Up key repeatedly

*Open System Preferences from the  Apple menu and select the “Sound” panel, followed by the “Output” tab. Select “Soundflower (2ch) from the Output list

*Now launch AU Lab, found in /Applications/Utilities/

*From the “Audio Input Device” pulldown menu, select “Soundflower (2ch)”, and then from “Audio Output Device” menu select “Stereo In/Stereo Out”

*Click the “Create Document” button at the bottom of the screen
At the next screen, look for “Output 1” column and click the “Effects” dropdown, selecting “AUGraphicEQ”

*This is your new system-wide equalizer, set it how you see fit. Changes here will impact all audio output on the Mac

*When satisfied with the EQ settings, hit Command+S to save the EQ settings file and put it somewhere easy to find like the Documents folder
Now open AU Lab preferences from the AU Lab menu, click on the “Document” tab and click the radiobox next to “Open a specific document”, selecting the .trak EQ file you saved in the previous step

*Optional final step: If you want the EQ settings to load on every Mac OS X boot, right-click on the AU Lab icon, go to Options, and select “Open at Login”
Note: It’s important to note that AU Lab must be running in order for the equalizer to have an effect, keeping it running will consume a small amount of CPU resources but it’s much less process hungry than some of the third party alternatives available on the market.

I read that some people got the same issue via a remote wipe, however, I'm not subscribed to mobile me, so there is no way that could have happened.

Huzzah! Editing my previously negative answer to report success! SSH in and get YOUR data off YOUR phone, thanks to a great tool that's so new it doesn't have a cool name yet: shh_rd. The author's blog post has a video walk-through.
If ssh_rd wasn't available, then Apple might be your best bet if your bricked iPhone is under warranty. If you have a 3GS or newer then a forensics specialist is probably necessary. Details below ...
There are very few tools that can access iOS device data directly - and these are usually available only to law enforcement and forensics agencies. (Though there is some interesting work being done on Linux with a library called libimobiledevice.)
One is iOS Forensic Research maintained by Jonathan Zdziarski who wrote the (now dated) book on the subject of ""iPhone Forensics"". Another is the Elcomsoft iOS Forensic Toolkit. There are also hardware assisted solutions like Cellebrite UFED.
Assuming you don't have access to these kinds of tools, the last resort is to restore the iPhone using iTunes, then jailbreak it and dump the filesystem. The 3GS and newer models use hardware to encrypt their filesystems so recovery is probably not feasible.
Filesystem dumps from phones prior to the 3GS can be scanned for files using software like PhotoRec.

Maybe some kind of program that can access the hard drive through the USB port? Or maybe I can open up the phone and somehow get the data off the hard drive?
I know that I can restore the phone through iTunes and have it working again. The problem is that I didn't back up the data so I have 400 or so notes saved only on the phone. If I restore it, they will be gone 

I have a Macbook Pro and I have the latest version of iTunes. I also have a USB cable that I can use to connect the phone to the computer.

I have a feeling that the data is still on the phone's hard drive but I don't know how to access it.

I have also read that if you open up the phone and connect the hard drive to a computer, you can access the data. But I don't know how to do that either.

I would really appreciate any advice you can give me. Thanks!"|0.341549813747406|0.1513157894736842

Update: I now have doubts a third party app exsits based on that Apple Drops Wi-Fi Sniffers from"|"iPhone App Store reports ""sniffers were dropped because they use a private framework, hooks in the operating system that are not documented nor allowed for third-party developers to use.""

A: As user83905 pointed out, syncing your iPod and Mac with iCloud Keychain will enable you to manage both devices' remembered networks from either one. This means you can simply delete it from your Mac and the change will sync to your iPod.
If you do not have a Mac available to sync with, however, you can still forget unwanted networks by going to Settings > General > Reset and tapping Reset Network Settings. You'll need to add the networks you use again, but it will clear everything out so you can start fresh.

A: IF you have a Mac:
Sync your iOS device and Mac with the same iCloud Apple keychain. The wifi information will sync via iCloud to the Mac's keychain. You can then edit the keychain on the Mac, and delete the unwanted networks.

A: You shouldn't worry too much as it only stores the settings (minimal storage impact), should you find a Wifi network with the same SSID, it may show up and ask you for the wap/wep passkey.

A: Seems like no way to do this at the moment. Workaround:

The only solution seems to be to rename a spare access point to the SSID of the network you want to forget, connect to it with the iPhone, and choose the option to forget the network. This kludge seems like a lot of work and something that an average user probably doesn’t know how or want to do

via http://www.novainfosecportal.com/2010/07/08/forget-this-network-pretty-please/

A: I have this problem when I'm on a tram. I once joined a network that was from a D-Link router, and the config hadn't been changed so that the network name was still the default - ""D-LINK"". Now,whenever I'm using my iPhone on public transport and we pass a similarly configured D-Link modem (there are several on my route) a pop up appears asking me for a password. It's actually kind of annoying - it interrupts me about twice per trip, every day. 
I need to be faster getting into settings before we travel out of range of the networks. 

A: You can reset your network settings and it will forget all networks

A: You can now open Keychain access on the Mac, and search for the wifi by name. It will give 2 results: One on the iCloud, and one from the System keychain. The Mac side can delete the iCloud only key, which leaves the system key copy on the Mac. The deletion will propagate to the iPhone in 10 minutes."|"Q: Can I ""Forget this Network"" when the wifi network is not in range?

Truth is, is not the “whole mac” but the Finder (and any Finder application) what freezes. For example, a Save/Open dialog, Time Machine starting, a Finder window, etc. However you can always cmd-tab and perform other actions.
There isn’t much you can do, except to tell OS X not to sleep your hard drives (or wait for the drive to spin up):
. Beware with that option, because it will mean that your hard drives are on all the time, thus degrading their lifespan.

60||"Q: Why does spaces keep capturing keyboard input some times after switching spaces? I'm running snow leopard on a fairly new macbook pro 13"" (september 2010).
Sometimes the black visualization showing the available spaces and the space I'm currently on doesn't disappear when I have switched between two spaces. When this happens, spaces seems to steals keyboard input from the application(s) on the space I have switched to. Sometimes the visualization disappears after I keep switch spaces some more, but sometimes I have to force a reboot. 
Also, spaces seems quite slow at times. 
Does anybody else experience the same thing, and is there anything to be done about it?

A: I find that killing the Dock only sometimes makes the problem go away. Usually keyboard input returns, but if I switch spaces using the keyboard shortcuts, the visualisation sticks around & keyboard input is stolen again.
What I have found to work is putting the display to sleep. I've had the bottom right corner of the screen set to do that for ages, so it's quite convenient for me. I've never had this method fail; once the screen is awoken, the problem is gone & doesn't return"|"when I switch spaces again.
To me this suggests that the problem isn't actually in Dock, it's in the system's EventTap subsystem, the bit that lets stuff like Spaces, Screen Sharing, LaunchBar, & Spotlight take keystrokes before the focussed application gets them. I've actually experienced a similar problem with Screen Sharing, where the system whose screen is being shared gets its keyboard input mangled if a modifier key is pressed on the viewing computer & not released until Screen Sharing has lost focus. It's sort of the reverse problem, but it indicates that perhaps the Spaces problem is the EventTap framework getting stuck in a similar way, never sending the message that Control isn't being held down any more.

A: I experience the same issue on a regular basis. Pressing CMD+W right after noticing that the spaces window will persist makes the window disappear most times.
If it doesn't, you can kill Dock from Activity Monitor (start it from the Applications folder in your Dock, select 'Dock' and click 'End Process' or the like). This always makes keyboard input work again, but the issue will reappear very soon.
If I could, I also would give bounty for this!
/Update: The Mac OS X 10.6.5 changelog suggests that this issue will be fixed in that version:

Addresses keyboard responsiveness
  issues in the Dock when Spaces is
  turned on.


A: I haven't figured out the why of it, per se, but I have figured out a good way to get around it; I created an Applescript application that lives in my dock that allows me to kill the Dock when this happens (since the keyboard is no longer responsive at that point).
Create this script in the AppleScript editor and save it as an application somewhere:
set app_name to ""Dock""
do shell script (""killall "" & app_name)

Add it to your Dock, and when Spaces grabs all keyboard input you can click it to restart the Dock, which will allow you to proceed.

A: This comment on the apple subreddit led me to this thread where people discuss this issue in relation to an application called Cinch. In the thread about this on the apple forums, people mention several other applications that might be causing this issue too.
What is causing this issue?
From what I can gather, this issue seems to be related to applications using Event Taps (an API that lets applications directly listen for keyboard and mouse events). I think there is either A) a bug in OS X where Event Taps sometimes stop working for whatever reason, or B) application programmers  consistently have a hard time using Event Taps correctly.
What can I do about it?
If this is indeed caused by an OS X bug (this seems the most likely to me), this issue can't be fixed completely by end users. There is one thing you can do that might make it happen less frequently though: In the Cinch thread, there is a link to an application that lists all running applications that have Event Taps open. It looks like this:
I figure that the more applications you are running that have an Event Tap open, the more often you'll end up with a clogged Event Tap somewhere, and you'll have the spaces issue happen more often as a consequence of this.
So, if you're having this issue, try running as few of the applications that show up in EventTaps.app as you can.
For whenever the issue does happen, kill the Dock using whatever method you find most convenient. I keep the AppleScript snippet that Chris R posted in his answer in an .app on my Desktop, and run it whenever spaces locks up."|"Q: Why does spaces keep capturing keyboard input some times after switching spaces?

A: 
Cocktail is an award winning general purpose utility for Mac OS X

This app does exactly what you are after (plus much much more), but it will set you back $15.
Alternatively, the command pmset appears to do this as well, but without the fancy GUI. For example pmset -c disksleep 60 will prevent all disks from spinning down within 60 minutes of activity when plugged in. You can change the -c part to specify a different power condition:

A: Keep Drive Spinning is a free alternative that does what you want.

A: The externals sleep routine is set by the drive's firmware. A few can respond to Energy Saver/Cocktail/pmset settings, most cannot.

You can find it here:
https://github.com/fauria/bigger-notes
Hope it helps.

A: UPDATE: KNotesWidget link is broken. I searched and found it here.
Perhaps you’re looking for KNotesWidget. (link is broken)

Provides an alternative to Apple’s stickies widget with more functionality: 
  
  
*
  
*unlimited text size 
  
*resizeable 
  
*collapseable 
  
*allows instant spawn of another k-note
  


A: Unfortunately I haven't come accross anything like Stickies on OS X.
I'm writing this in the hope a Mac developer researching the topic sees an opportunity.
Features from Stickies that I am missing:


*

*Toggle Stickies on and off with a global keyboard shortcut.

*I don't want to go through the Dashboard, I want Stickies to pop on my desktop on command!

*Set an alarm for any Sticky. Awesome for reminders, or daily tasks. The Sticky note goes"|"to ""sleep"" (it hides) and will pop on your desktop at the required time. You can even have it play a sound and animate!

*Simple auto formatting of links. You can drag the browser's uri to a Stickies. You can click links in Stickies to open in browser. Great for keeping lists of articles to read (why would I create a new online account, or use a browser extension when I can freely edit my list anyway I want? Not to mention it is saved somewhere on my harddrive that I can easily read without the application running, and backup).

*If the text gets long, a scrollbar appears. You can choose how much screen estate to use for your Stickies.

*You can easily set the title of the Stickies.

*You can manage the Stickies, hide ones you don't want to see now, and bring them back later. So in effect it also works as a small notes database, but it is primarily a great scratchpad.

*Being able to hide a Stickies is great because sometimes you may want to keep a Stickies visible while working on something, and you might want to hide others which get in the way.

*Stickies had awesome shortcuts like: bring back all ""hidden"" stickies in view.

*They were not as pretty as OS X Stickies, but you could set transparency and colours freely.


In general I find Mac apps to be superior in usability and looks, but this is one type of app where nearly every attempt I've seen on OS X veers towards ""personal wiki"" (too much), or online synching (don't need), or just plain clunky (dashboard widget).
I used Stickies on Windows for YEARS. I would totally pay 20 € or more for that on OS X.

A: I know this is old but Ill add one that I just found in case people are still looking at this. It's called WikityWidgets I have yet to use it because I just downloaded it but does look like it will be pretty good.

A: I'm using SimpleNote on my Mac and iPhone for pretty much all my note-taking. It automatically syncs notes between computers/devices, so might not be for you if you only want local notes. I find it's really convenient for accessing my notes everywhere, though.
It doesn't look like big sticky notes, instead you get a list view of your notes with a preview, from which you can open the entire note. I find it really pretty, but it might not be the aestethic you're after.
Edit: Forgot to mention that I use the DashNote widget on my Macs. There are other options as well, but they mainly come as stand-alone programs.

A: http://junecloud.com/software/dashboard/notefile.html
Just what you asked for. Its much better than the default stickies.

A: I use Tomboy notes.  It's similar to stickies, but with some nice extra features.  


*

*Link notes together simply by typing a previous notes title in your current note

*Recently accessed notes are quickly accessible

*You can 'pin' notes so that they are always quickly accessible

*Create multiple notebooks


Searching notes and linking related notes together is really easy.  The only feature I think it's lacking is a way to sync with my iPhone.

A: Check out Secret NotePad. It looks like you can resize it, lock it, and apply various styles to it. It also looks pretty nice.

A: Don't use stickies, especially the widget ones that come with the computer because if you click the checkmark box they disapear and you loose all your information. Unless there is  a majic way of recovering the data. 

A: Simple Antnotes (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simple-antnotes/id846599902?mt=12) is a good one.
Pros:
1. A nice interface with a widget. A click will bring it all and another click        will hide it all. No accidental delete. Easy to use hide options.
2.Resize, start on login options.
3.""Make on top"" option with a nice pin button. (ONE THAT IS REALLY HELPFUL)
4.""Make translucent on inactive"", ""Hide on inactive"" options.

68||"Q: Can I use Time Machine to back up data to a Windows shared drive? How can I do ""Time Machine"" from my Mac OS X 10.6.4 to my Window share drive? I'd also prefer to encrypt my image, so it's ""safe"" just in case :-)

A: In order to create a Time Machine backup to an unsupported drive (pretty much anything that's not formatted HFS+) you need to run the following Terminal command:
defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1

Your share will now show up as a valid Time Machine destination in the Time Machine Preference Pane.
Time Machine will then create a disk image on that drive that will act just like a HFS+ drive for Time Machines purposes (hard linking, etc.). One advantage of using a disk image over using the entire drive is that you can limit the size it will grow to of the disk image using Disk Utility.
Be sure to check Louis Gerbarg's answer as well for why it's unsupported and you have to jump through a hoop to enable it.

A: There are various hacks to setup a diskimage on the share, which I am sure other people will describe in depth. Having said that"|"DO NOT USE SMB TO STORE TIME MACHINE BACKUPS.
Guaranteeing writes on a disk image backed over a network store is complicated. Apple had reliability issues with Time Machine over AFP for years, and they controlled the entire stack. In order to guarantee write ordering and write stability (which are necessary in order for Time Machine to work in the presence of intermittent networking, such as walking out or range of the base station or putting the machine to sleep midbackup and waking it up out of range) Time Machine depends on features specific to AFP (For those interested, those are published as part of the Time Machine Network Server Requirements).
If you want to backup to a Windows Machine you should probably get a copy of ExtremeZ-IP, if it is a linux box running SAMBA you should install netatalk.

A: I did not test this solution, but looks someone did a little write up for this:
OSX Timemachine and Samba/Windows share « Hupio’s Weblog

A: Yes with caveats

*

*Create a sparsebundle disk image per these instructions Windows NTFS Linux or other disk for Time Machine Backups and move it to your network file share

*Optional: Add the disk image as a login item so that it is mounted when you log-in

*

* Menu -> System Preferences -> Users and Groups -> Login Items -> '+' button -> Navigate to the network drive and select the sparsebundle

*Or, add a cron job for a 2 line script:

*

*osascript -e 'mount volume ""smb://username@servername/sharename""'

*hdiutil attach /Volumes/servernameandorsharename 
(The advantage of osascript over bash is that osascript will remember your password)






*If your disk doesn't appear as an option in Time Machine preferences use the line from Chealion's answer: defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1.

*

*And/Or use the commandline: tmutil setdestination /Volumes/Volumenameonceitsbeenmounted




*Buy a copy of Alsoft DiskWarrior.

The problem is, as @louis-gerbarg says, backup to a network share is a risk unless your server, router, network and client are all very reliable. The symptom is then that the disk no longer mounts and your backup no longer runs.

I have been doing Time Machine backup to network share for 10 years and I reckon on a disk repair every other month. I have sometimes got through a year with Disk Utility or chkdsk alone repairing errors but that left me with a trail of old broken backup images.

That said, the better perspective is:

*

*If you don't have 3 copies, you aren't serious about backup. Therefore:

*You should also have everything duplicated to somewhere that's at least fire-and-theft-isolated from your machine. Some combination of iDrive, OneDrive, Github, Syncthing, Cubbit, diy Azure storage, for instance.

*That leaves me still using TimeMachine primarily for the convenience of recent versions: 'darn get me the version from yesterday'. It's a great interface. So now I'm less concerned about losing last year's TM backups so long as I can start a new TM backup tonight.


A: Unfortunately, I don't believe you can. From the Time Machine help docs:
Time Machine can’t back up to an external disk connected to an AirPort Extreme, or to an iPod, iDisk, or disk formatted for Windows.
EDIT: Ignore this answer. As mentioned in comments, Apple's own documentation is out of date."|"Q: Can I use Time Machine to back up data to a Windows shared drive? How can I do ""Time Machine"" from my Mac OS X 10.6.4 to my Window share drive? I'd also prefer to encrypt my image, so it's ""safe"" just in case :-)
 A:You can use the following command in terminal to enable Time Machine to back up to an unsupported drive: 
defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1

After this, you should be able to select the share in Time Machine. 
The backup will be stored as a disk image on the share, which can be limited in size using Disk Utility. 
Please note that this is a hack and is not officially supported by Apple. 
Please also note that this only works on Mac OS X 10.6.4, as newer versions of Mac OS X do not support the com.apple.systempreferences plist. 
If you are running a newer version of Mac OS X, you will need to use a different method.

*IMAP: Folders, syncs read/unread"|"status

*POP3: Bare bones email reading, usually only useful for a single client unless you ""keep a copy on the server""


It seems that some people have had success using Exchange; IMAP seems to require either a premium account or 3rd party software; and POP3 is possible for free accounts.
Keep an eye on Apple's page as they will probably update it as new solutions are added by Microsoft.

A: From what I understand, Microsoft doesn't allow Hotmail IMAP access. The workaround is IzyMail. I haven't tried it, but it seems like it works as an intermediary between the iPhone and Hotmail servers in order to get a ""simulated"" IMAP experience lol.
Senseful's post has a good information. I use Exchange for my work email, calendars and contacts, and I love it. Gmail works really well with IMAP, and I really do not like POP3 from past experiences.

A: Came back to add an update:
In iOS 5 or later, you can add Microsoft Hotmail natively on the ""add account"" setup screen.

This summer Apple changed built-in mail app to support ""archive"" button (at least for GMail and GApps-based accounts), but I have found that I need to delete emails much more often than archive them.

Is there a way to bring back ""delete"""|"instead of ""archive"" button or any other way to quickly delete messages?

A: Ok, for iPad users. I just literally solved this.

You also have some options for changing the folder paths here, but don't worry about it.
Save the changes and click done. And next time you swipe away a message it would have a red box with trash instead of archive.
You are welcome.

A: One way to do this is to setup gmail using IMAP-setup instead of the normal Gmail-setup. That way you can configure if you want the messages to be archived or deleted when you push the trash-icon.
You can find Gmail IMAP settings instructions here:

ultramobile and all your data at home on your network (e.g. time capsule or some sort of network attached storage): also did this for a while, no hickups, works great via 802.11g although I'd recommend 802.11n if you're likely to watch HD videos straight from your NAS/Time capsule.
ultramobile and all your data always with you: that's the approach I'm currently using, I have a 500g usb2 drive I carry in my notebook bag containing my itunes library and assorted other data (iphoto library and what not) that doesn't fit on the internal drive. 
It's my favorite solution as I have my data on me even if there is no internet connection available.
cheers
florian

A: Florian’s answer covers basically all the scenarios. You can, however, have a mix between option 2 and 3. 
Some programs (notably iPhoto and iTunes) allow you to select different libraries upon startup. 
If you press Alt when starting, it will prompt for your library. You can then, have two libraries, one at “home” with all your stuff that you use when you are home and connected (to a big external drive for example), and other small library, locally stored on your Macbook Air. 
This is not the best of the methods as it requires you to remember to switch libraries (tho nothing bad happens if you forget) and it also has the problem of “duplicating” certain data. I.e.: all the music you want to carry, you have to copy twice, one to your big library and other to the “mobile” library. 
Regarding Pictures, unless you always want to carry them all with you at all times, it’s best to use any online service to store them and keep only the “most important” in your iPhoto, or the ones you haven’t yet processed. 
FInally, as you have correctly stated, the Macbook Air can serve as a main computer, however, its connectivity and hardware limitations clearly indicate that despite the above, the machine is more aimed at portability than anything else. 
Last but not least, you can always upgrade the internal hard-drive of your Macbook Air, and although it could prove to be an expensive solution, SSD drivers higher than 256MB are already available and of course normal magnetic drives go way further than that (for a fraction of the price of an SSD)."|"Q: Should I use a network-attached Time Capsule or a USB external drive with my MacBook Air?

I would recommend using an external hard drive instead of a Time Capsule. External hard drives are much faster and have more storage space. You can just connect it to your MacBook Air and copy the files you want to keep onto it. Then you can free up space on your laptop by moving or deleting the files you don't need. This will help you manage your disk space more efficiently.

If you want to keep your files synced between your laptop and external hard drive, you can use a backup program like Backblaze or Carbon Copy Cloner. These programs will automatically sync new files on your laptop with the external hard drive, so you don't have to worry about manually copying them yourself. They also offer additional features like automatic backup, cloud storage, and mobile device syncing, so they can help you keep all of your devices updated with the latest versions of your files.

If you want to keep your files on a Time Capsule, you can still use it as a shared drive. However, the performance will be slower since the data has to be copied over the network. You might also experience some lag when you're working with large files or doing multiple operations at once. If you want to keep your files on a Time Capsule for backup purposes, you can use a backup program like Time Machine to automatically back up your laptop to the Time Capsule. This will help you protect your data in case your laptop crashes or gets stolen.

Overall, I would recommend using an external hard drive instead of a Time Capsule or a laptop as your main machine. External hard drives are faster and have more storage space, and they're also easier to manage and keep updated.

Send it to iTunes so you you can sync it over to your iPhone.
Create a new contact called ""IGNORE"" or something that will let you know it's one of those unwanted callers. Assign the silent ringtone to that contact. (this allows you to keep your default ringtone audible)

A: Pixelpipe
From https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/3486/is-there-a-way-to-upload-higher-resolution-videos-to-youtube-or-any-video-sharin

This free app allows iPhone 4 users to
directly upload their 720P videos to
YouTube, as well as Flickr, Facebook,
MobileMe, Viddler, Posterous and a

I recommend that post, it gives some great information on the app and how it is used.
For example:

A “pipe” is the
connector between the PixelPipe app
and one or more destination sites
where you want your content to be
uploaded. For example, I set up pipes
for flickr, picasa, and Dropbox and
many others.
I setup some of my pipes as default
routes. This means that any media I
select to upload will automatically go
to these default pipes.
For each pipe
I created, PixelPipe created a routing
tag. The routing tag explicitly tells
PixelPipe where to upload the content
overriding any default routes. If you
want your content routed to different
photo sets you can create a routing
pipe and tag for each one.

Also, given this:

since other developers are sure to create a similar product now that they know it is possible to upload 720p videos.

If you don't like the PixelPipe app, it shouldn't be too long before another solution pops up :)
According to this page, an app called SmugMug is also 720p uploading enabled, however I couldn't find much in reference to that on their site.

*iMovie - very slick, great editing, many upload options like YouTube, Vimeo and others

*Posterous - very powerful blogging tool for free.

*Vimeo - free but not [yet] as slick as iMovie

A: In addition to P2P sharing and audio streaming like Doug said, if you have a jailbroken 3G one, you can create a wifi hotspot using MiFi.

A: Also, some emulators allow you to use a Wii controller via Bluetooth.

A: There are Bluetooth-to-IR devices (for example) that let you control your TV and other devices from your iPad over Bluetooth.

A: Tethering
You can “tether” your iPad to an iPhone to use its cellular"|"data service as a “mobile hotspot”. For when you need internet access on-the-go.
You can do this via WiFi as well. Using Bluetooth instead may provide some advantages, such as saving on battery because the radio signal is weaker and needs less juice.
For details, see MacWorld article Use Bluetooth to tether your iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad by Glenn Fleishman.
By the way, a third way to tether is via USB cable. 

A: Starting with iOS 7, Bluetooth on iPad (as well as other select iOS and Mac devices) can be used to exchange files and information wirelessly in an ad-hoc manner using a feature called AirDrop.
Bluetooth is also employed when setting up and communicating with other Apple devices like AirPods, HomePod and Apple TV. With Bluetooth turned on, even a new iOS device can be easily set up by transferring content using an iOS feature called Quick Start.
Another interesting application with Bluetooth turned on is to easily share Wi-Fi password with nearby iOS devices belonging to saved contacts without entering it manually. Instructions can be found in the 9to5Mac article:


*

*Easily share your WiFi with friends on iOS 11, automatically sends passwords to nearby devices

iOS 11 includes many automatic features regarding first-time setup and account login. This extends to WiFi networks too. If a friend comes over with an iPhone running iOS 11, you can automatically log them in to your WiFi in one tap.


A: You can do peer-to-peer networking on bluetooth with some games and other applications.
I haven't checked out the details but my understanding is that the Bluetooth profile is much better in the iPhone 4 and iPad than in the early iPhones.

How Can I Search A Specific Type of File in Mac? 

How could I use spotlight to search for example for files that end with jar or files that end with doc and at the same time"|"contains ""Hello"" in it's name?

A: I’m assuming by “end with” you mean that files have the extension .jar or .doc. And given all those filenames, you want those who have “hello” in their filnames.
With that in mind, you’re looking for something like this:
(.jar AND “hello"") OR (.doc AND “hello”)

Additionally, you could extend the number of “words” by adding: 
(.jar AND “hello” OR “some_other_word"") OR (.doc AND “hello”)

Any help is appreciated!

A: You basically have three options for Virtualization on Mac OS X:


*

*The already mentioned (and free) VirtualBox

*The first solution for Mac (and arguably one of the best ones these days) Parallels for Mac

*The very famous VMware Fusion, from VMWare Inc.


Any of these will allow you to run a variety of OSs under OS X without resorting to bootcamp or repartitioning. 
The last two are not free, but -depending upon your needs- vastly superior in terms of features to VirtualBox. I have the three. I have used the three extensively. In its current versions, Parallels is ahead of VMware. But"|"this changes very often with new versions. Virtual Box is ok but slower (to virtualize) and has way less features. 
VMware is very stable. It never crashed in more than three years of daily usage. 
Parallels does perform certain tasks faster than VMware, but will occasionally crash the VM. (It happened about 5 times in a two year period).
In the end, either will work if you don’t need anything fancy. 

A: You could also consider using bootcamp to partition your hard drive to run different operating systems.
Although you need to reboot to switch OS's I find that one advantage is it runs faster since it isn't being run as a program inside the Mac OS.
You can also use those same partitions when using Paralles which is a good vm software, however it isn't free.

A: Clearly it's not free, but if you're a professional who NEEDS access to various flavors of operating systems for your daily work, VMware Fusion is absolutely worth every single penny you spend on it. I'm a web developer, and even though most of my work is built in OS X, I'm constantly testing websites and webapps in IE 6-8, and being able to run separate instances of Windows XP and 7 at the same time has saved me so much effort and time that I can't even begin to describe it.

A: You could try VirtualBox.
From its webpage : 
VirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Presently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris hosts and supports a large number of guest operating systems including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 and 2.6), Solaris and OpenSolaris, and OpenBSD.
VirtualBox is being actively developed with frequent releases and has an ever growing list of features, supported guest operating systems and platforms it runs on. VirtualBox is a community effort backed by a dedicated company: everyone is encouraged to contribute while Sun ensures the product always meets professional quality criteria.
I'm using it since I realise I didn't have to pay for having a good virtualization software on Mac OS X.
I can tell you it works really well, it's easy to setup and very stable."|"Q: How can I set up a virtual machine on my MacBook Pro? Ideally, I'm looking for free or low-cost solutions... I'd like to test out a variety of operating systems (windows, linux, mac os, etc).

83||"Q: Has anyone experienced ergonomic problems with the Magic Mouse? I used a Magic Mouse for the past few months. Very soon after I started using it I developed some aching in my hand. Over time this has grown to be more or less constant, even when not using the mouse for a while. I just switched back to an old bulky Logitech mouse, and just resting my hand on it feels much better. The Magic Mouse seems way too flat to be comfortable for prolonged use.
I know this is a rather subjective question, but have other people experienced similar ergonomic problems with the Magic Mouse? Is there any study about it?

A: Probably does.
Which is why I picked up the Magic Mouse Fix. Worked excellent.
Then I got the Magic Trackpad and realized why I hate mice.

A: I have serious pain in the base of my"|"thumb because of this device. I will try the trackpad and if that doesn't take care of it, I'll be switching to a Microsoft mouse.

A: You're seeing some first indications of RSI because you're using your hand in ways you're not used to, and possibly because the mouse doesn't fit your hand. 
Switching to a normal mouse is a good first aid, especially since you noticed that the problem disappeared or became less of a problem. For some people, it just takes time to get used to new movements, while others won't be able to use the new device for longer periods of time. Those unlucky people should not force themselves to use devices that aren't comfortable for them, and this might include you.
The problem with the magic mouse, IMHO, is that it's too small to really be useful as a gesture device because you're gesturing with the same hand that you use to hold it. That's bound to be awkward, which stresses your hand's anatomy, and some people develop problems from that. Others might not notice any problems -- everybody is different.
Solution:


*

*Change to a different mouse.

*If you must use gesture input, use a separate device for that. Apple offers the magic touchpad, which is a simpler and smaller version of the original FingerWorks iGesture series of devices which you can still buy used on eBay. And their laptops have multitouch trackpads too.


A: I own a Magic Mouse but don't use it regularly. I haven't notice any aching in my hand. I know another person who suffers from RSI and uses it with his left hand instead of his right. No problem too. 

A: I would suggest using 3M Ergonomic Mouse.  It works best for me and many programmers/hackers I know.


A: I've had a magic mouse for just over a week (as part of a new iMac) and have started feeling RSI type pain in my hand just below the fingers after prolonged use (ie., constant use for 30mins or more). I've never had any pain from the 25 years of using a normal mouse on a daily basis.
I purchased Apple Care with my new Mac and have contacted Apple about this issue today. Their response was; ""This is the first we have heard of this."" Despite lots of complaints on the internet about ergonomic problems of the magic mouse, apparently I am the first person to advise Apple direct of this!! Hmmm, i don't think so.
Their solution - buy a Track Pad, or buy a USB Logitech mouse. 
Shocking. I would've expected better from Apple."|thumb when using the Magic Mouse. I can’t use it for long without feeling pain in my hand.|0.42652320861816406|0.06369426751592357
84||"Q: Is it my imagination or do iPods charge faster using a car charger? Maybe I'm crazy, but it sure seems like when I plug my electronics (iPhone, iPod, etc.) into a car charger it gets up to a full charge MUCH faster than if I use a regular charger and an outlet. 
Do these devices charge faster from car adapters, or am I imagining this? If so, why?

A: The answer to this question is that ""it depends"" and it is actually quite possible that your car charger is charging your devices faster than the AC charger you use at home. In both cases, there is significant power available at the source to do the charging relative to the number of watts being used to charge the device. That is, both the AC wall outlet and the cigarette lighter socket are both going to have ""hundreds"" of WATTS available if not more whereas the device being charged is only going to be consuming maybe ""tens"" of WATTs at the most during peak charging rates.
Therefore what makes the difference is the amount of power being OUTPUT by the particular charger itself....you just need to check the ratings of the charger and see how much power than can each OUTPUT. The output power is simply VOLTS times AMPS for the DC power that your device is likely to be using.
Some wall chargers that are very inexpensive have very small power supplies in them and only put out a limited amount of charging current at the rated charging voltage for your device. Others may be quite a bit beefier and will be output up to or above the maximum the device will take. Similarly for the car adapter.
Given that the DC"|"source from the car is directly available and a very low cost regulator can be used to generate a regulated charging voltage without having to convert using a switching power supply from an AC line, it seems more than likely that you have a car charger that charges quicker than your home unit. Also, it is possible that the device accepts a variable input DC voltage and can take the 9V to 12V range from the car directly. In this case, it is quite possible that the car charger will end up delivering significantly more charging power than the AC charger.

A: The amount of power you draw from cars is quite limited, so it must be your imagination. The reason is probably because you are doing something instead of going back and forth checking. So it's more your sense of time that's different.
A more detailed explanation:
Typically what you get from a car at it's raw state, is something like 9-12 volts. What you get from your house is around 200-300 Volts, it depends where in the world you live. When you're changing a small gizmo, like iphone/ipad, that has a small power usage, 9-12 volts is just fine. However if you were to charge a laptop you would see what I mean. You would have to convert the 9-12 volts to 200-300, (a factor of 20-30) and would thus have to decrease the amperage with the same factor. The result would be that your laptop could hold power for a longer period of time, but would eventually go flat.
So there is a limit to how much power (Walt) you can draw from a car, and it will always be a lot lower than what you can get at home. If you are a skilled electrician you could raise the amount of power by accessing the car battery directly.
Now why isn't it a lot faster to charge your iphone at home?
Well it easily could be, but charging a battery at a very high pace, will also create a lot of heat. Apple have probably taken this into consideration when they created the charger for the iPhone. A balance between having a low charge time, without heating the battery too much which could risk the health or just the durability of the phone.

A: I'll disclaim this post by stating upfront I am no sort of electrical engineer, but two things stick out to me as possibilities:


*

*Phones operate on DC power. Any charging effort has to ensure the power is being delivered in DC form. This means charging from the AC outlet has to do a conversion, where as the power from the outlet on your car only has to be regulated. Which brings me to my second point..

*The power from your car is already in DC form. If regulated correctly, it should be no different from the wall charger. If you're seeing drastically different charging times I would suspect either the wall charger is limited to prevent too much heat buildup, or your car charger is allowing more direct charging to occur (maybe at the expense of your battery?)
Maybe batteries are 40VDC in Denmark, but they are (mostly) 12VDC in the US (which seems to be where the OP is from). Any car should have more than enough power to charge a phone. My Blackberry charger is only 5V 700mA. My truck has 12v with 30amp circuits... if not regulated I would probably have a fireball on my hands in a matter of seconds.  ;)
Just something to consider...

A: My iPhone charges twice as fast when being charged with a 3rd party after market charger in the car (DC), as opposed to the Apple AC charger.
In my case DC is definitely faster

A: My experience is the car charger I use restores my iPhone battery at a FAR GREATER speed than does any device at home: my USB charger in the wall, my USB charger at my computers, and my iHome and other stereo docks.  It's not even close—maybe as much as 4 or 5 times fewer minutes to full recharge. 

A: Ok... I'm going to put this in simple terms... most car chargers, especially the cheaper ones, don't have voltage regulators on them.  This WILL cause them to charge your phone faster. Some CHEAPER chargers don't have them either and will do the same.  HOWEVER, you should know home chargers are designed to be slower and ""trickle charge"" your battery because this is safer.  Speed charging damages the battery in time and will limit your battery's charge capacity even though it will read full.  If you look on your home charger it will state this.  
For example:  my home charger says on it,
input 100-240v
Output 5.1v
Why would my BRAND NAME MOTORLA CHARGER want to lower the voltage output?   Because it prolongs battery life.  This link has a little more tech talk in it on the subject... slightly.  http://chris.pirillo.com/are-mobile-car-chargers-good-for-phone-batteries/

A: I think it's because we're charging straight from USB and there's no Adapter involved.

86||"Q: Can I transfer backups when replacing a Time Capsule? If I get a new Time Capsule, how can I transfer the backups from the old Time Capsule to the new one. I see an option to Archive the Time Capsule from the Airport Utility, but I don't see any way to restore. Do I have to go through the initial back up process again with all of my Macs?

A: From Apple Support Knowledge Base...
Time Capsule, Mac OS X v10.6.3 or later: How to transfer your back up from an existing Time Capsule to a new one
For this process, you should leave your computer in the same room as the Time Capsules, or use one Ethernet cable to connect your Mac to the Ethernet port on the existing Time Capsule, then use another Ethernet cable to connect from the existing Time Capsule to the new"|"Time Capsule.


*

*Configure your Time Capsule for your network. See the documentation
that came with your Time Capsule for information about setting it up
on your network. 

*Open Time Machine preferences in System
Preferences.

*Slide the Time Machine switch to Off. 

*Open a Finder
window. 

*Locate both Time Capsules listed in the SHARED section of
the navigation pane on the left of the Finder window.  Note: If you
do not see your Time Capsules in that section, choose Preferences
from the Finder menu and make sure ""Connected servers"" is checked
under SHARED. 

*Select the name of the new Time Capsule in the
navigation pane. The default name is ""Time Capsule xxxxxx"", with
xxxxxx being the last digits of the ID printed on the bottom of the
Time Capsule. 

*Mount the volume by double-clicking the name of the
volume in the Finder window's main section. The default drive name
is ""Data"". 

*Open a new Finder window by pressing Command-N, or by
choosing File > New Finder Window. 

*Repeat the previous 2 steps with
the other Time Capsule, to mount it. Drag your backup disk image
from the current Time Capsule to the new Time Capsule. This can take
some time to complete because your entire backup will be copied.

*Open Time Machine preferences in System Preferences. 

*Click ""Select
Disk..."", then select your new Time Capsule. 

*Perform a Time Machine
back up. 

*After the back up, you can remove the Ethernet cables if
desired and configure your wireless network to your liking.


A: This is a slow way but dead simple. After letting the new time capsule absorb the setting from the old one and hooking it up to your network then just reconnect with Airport Utility to the old one. Reconfigure the old one to extend your network instead of making a new one. 
Now you can mount both drives and copy files between then as you wish.

A: Some time ago I read an article about this procedure but it's a bit of a hack.
I won't copy it here because it's a 12-point tutorial.
Anyway, I was too lazy to test it, so I cannot guaranty it will work.
Maybe someone will post a better solution.

A: If you can find a way to hook up the TImeCapsule's drive to your mac directly you might get away with this simple Disk Utility trick:

iCal has an option to print the day's events in list format, but the output is in two columns and a few of the lines write over each other and are completely unreadable.
If I try to print the invitation as it came to me in Mail, the output has"|"an iCal icon showing the attachment -- not the contents of the attachment.
So, short of copy/paste into TextEdit, Word, etc, is there a clean way to print this?
I asked this on superuser a few months ago and got no answers at all. Are the apple fanboys more active here?

A: Better question: If the output from iCal was readable, would it be sufficient? The reason I ask, is because iCal word wraps within the two day columns, making the overlapping issue unusual. Perhaps the issue is with the iCal Application Support files or .plist

A: Would going into iCal's day view, taking a screenshot & printing be a good solution for your needs?

A: Revisiting this over a year and a half later...
This has been improved in iCal in OS X Lion. On the print dialog, there's an option to print only the selected event. Also, the day option or list option will print the full contents without messing up the formatting or overwriting other lines.
In other ways iCal in Lion is worse, but it's definitely better for printing calendar entries.

A: If we're talking about a single invite, and you wanted to go backwards in time and rely on paper (again) you could print the email invite. If you're wanting to print a collection of events you could make an applescript to do that quite easily. Drop the email onto your script have it open the attachment, screen shot the window of the appointment & overly that on top of the email.

89||"Q: Help Creating a Smart Playlist I am hoping someone can help me with a smart playlist creation question.
I have two smart playlists (A and B) 


*

*Playlist A contains songs that are
""singles"" (meaning I don't have the
full album) and are not in playlist B

*Playlist B contains songs in my
Library that are rated 5-stars
I would like to create playlist C that includes all songs for a specific genre in playlist A and B.
This sounds simple, but if an artist is in Playlist A and B, I can't get the songs in Playlist B to appear.

A: Before creating a playlist, you have to separate the items into very small pieces, otherwise, you risk contradicting yourself. 

Playlist A contains songs that are
  ""singles"" (meaning I don't have the
  full album) and are not in playlist B

Why are you using “not in"|"playlist B”? I assume you want to have a list of ’singles’ that are 1-4 stars rated. Why not add that to the conditions?
Now your “A"" list should be the same as before, but doesn’t mention B at all.
Now you happen to have a list “B” that has 5 rated songs (the good ones!).
And now you want your less than 5 rated singles (A) of “XX Genre”, and your 5 star ones…
As easy as it sounds, in practice it’s more difficult… because what sounds like “this and that” is not really like that.
Let me try to replicate. 
My “A” playlist is (I’ve used Track = 1 but I’m sure your condition to determine singles is different and I’m taking 0,1,2 and 3 stars)

My B playlist is easier:

Now I have a C one… that contains tracks from A that have a “Rock” genre:

We’re getting close!
Now we need to group B and C into a single D playlist to enjoy the Joy of single Rocks and 5 start songs! 
Here’s our D list:

And that’s it. Now two things are important:


*

*This song must always be in any playlist or you’re doing it wrong.

*If you also want to include the “genre” in the B playlist (is not clear), then modify B playlist to also have a “rock” genre.


Ahhh the joy of playlists. :)
EDIT: You specified two pseudo-contradictory things, but here’s the idea:

Playlist B contains songs in my Library that are rated 5-stars

cannot be intersected with:

all songs for a specific genre in playlist A and B.

In order to achieve that, you’ll have to modify (or create a B2) list that is:


*

*Match All of the following rules:

*“Rating is *****”

*Genre is “Rock”


You can’t modify a previous list from a new. This is not a relational database. Smart lists only work as far as simple pascal logic goes. True/False/Intersection/Union… 
If you don’t want to change your B playlist (because you use it for something else), go ahead and create B2 and make it include “all from B” and “Genre is rock” and use that B2 in your final “D” creation, much like we created the “C” list, which is pretty much “A” with Rock Genre. 

A: *

*You state that C should be an intersection of D (genre) and A and B.

*You define A as a subset of NOT B.


Assuming you don't have songs twice, once in single form rated <5* and once in album form rated 5*, I think that the two statements above define C as the null set.
Perhaps C should be D AND (A OR B).

A: Try creating new playlist P0 = songs in A + songs in B, and then P1 = P0 AND (Genre = ...)."|"playlist B” here? If you want to create a playlist that includes only the songs that are not in playlist B, you should just create a new playlist and add those songs, and then remove the songs from playlist B that are in the new playlist.

Playlist B contains songs in my
 Library that are rated 5-stars

Here you say that playlist B contains songs that are rated 5-stars, but you also say that you want to create a playlist that includes only the songs that are not in playlist B. Since the songs in playlist B are also the songs that are rated 5-stars, this means that the songs you want to include in your new playlist are the songs that are not in playlist B and are also rated 5-stars.

I would like to create playlist C that includes all songs for a specific genre in playlist A and B.

This means that you want to create a playlist that includes only the songs that are in playlist A and are also for a specific genre. However, you also want to make sure that the songs in this new playlist are not in playlist B. Since the songs in playlist B are also for a specific genre, this means that the songs you want to include in your new playlist are the songs that are in playlist A but are not in playlist B and are also for a specific genre.

This sounds simple, but if an artist is in Playlist A and B, I can't get the songs in Playlist B to appear.

If an artist is in both playlist A and playlist B, then their songs will appear in both playlists. However, if you want to create a playlist that includes only the songs from playlist A that are not in playlist B, you will need to create two separate playlists: one that includes the songs from playlist A that are not in playlist B, and one that includes the songs from playlist B.

A: I think I understand what you want to do. You want to create a playlist that includes only the songs that are in playlist A but are not in playlist B, and you also want to make sure that the songs in this new playlist are for a specific genre.
The easiest way to do this is to create two separate playlists: one that includes the songs from playlist A that are not in playlist B, and one that includes the songs from playlist B. Then you can merge these two playlists together to create the final playlist that includes only the songs that are in playlist A and are for a specific genre.
If you try to do this in one playlist, you may end up with songs that are in both playlist A and B, which you probably don't want."|0.36628055572509766|0.2311661506707946

However, the iPod touch does not have GPS capabilities, although it does have WiFi-based location services, if I'm not mistaken. Do location-aware apps work on the iPod touch? If so, how well? I'm not interested in the iPhone right now, but since I live in a city, it would be cool to have a device that would allow me to call up maps and such when I'm walking around.

A: Yes. The ""location services"" work the same way on all iOS devices, while the specifics of how that data is obtained are hidden from the application.
This Apple support article might be helpful to you:


*

*iPhone and iPod touch: Understanding Location Services

A: Yes, most definitely.  I was actually quite astonished by the accuracy too.  I have a fourth generation iPod Touch (and this story was back with the iOS 4 operating system).  It actually made me sort of paranoid at first, until I looked into the technology behind it.
I was walking through a parking lot and staring at the Maps app on my iPod when I realized that every couple of seconds the pointer would move.  The device was literally tracking my position as I walked through the parking lot, literally with the precision of a parking space. WOW.
Here is the real kicker, though.  The device does not have GPS nor was there an internet WiFi connection!  How does that work, right?!?!  My WiFi was turned on, but it was not connected to anything. I had heard of GPS and I had heard of looking up"|"the IP-address (that the Internet Service Providers assign), but I had not heard of anything that would explain this.
Apparently, the device actually triangulates (like cell tower triangulation on cell phones), but with WiFi hotspots.  You dont have to be connected to the internet nor to the networks in question to use WiFi triangulation.  Your device has a database of local WiFi hotspots that it looked up the last time it connected to the internet.
Now, I dont know where this database comes from. If it looked up ALL local WiFi spots based on your location. Or if it looked up only WiFi connections that it has detected in the past (but didnt know locations for at the time). Or what. But somehow the device builds a database of WiFi connections that it recognizes later and recalls location information for. The device is capable of detecting and recognizing many, many more WiFi signals than it displays in your WiFi connections window, the latter being only the ones that are strong and coherent enough to make useable connections to.
Later, your device can use the signal strength, direction, distance, so forth, relative to one or more WiFi hotspots, to compute your location.  And guess what? It even works with password protected WiFi that you cant access.
If you connect to the internet via a public WiFi, it will update the database tables with more, newer information based on your new location and other networks it has detected on your way there.  Each WiFi connection has a special numeric code associated with it (Im not sure if this is the IP address, or MAC address, or what) that the device looks up online and pulls geographic coordinates for.
I can walk through neighborhoods in my area that I have never been to before, and without connecting to any internet there, the device will still pinpoint my location. But only if both WiFi is turned on and Location Services is turned on. I would only turn the former off to preserve battery life and the latter to protect anonymity.
This method of triangulation is more accurate than, and your device prefers it over, the more commonly recognized IP-address lookup.  Once you establish an internet connection, your device can use your IP address to determine your location within a certain radius.  The precision is no better than the radius of the WiFi signal, coupled with the precision of determining the location of the hardwired network hardware.
The only location service your device prefers over WiFi triangulation is the GPS chip, which is only available on certain models of certain devices.
What your device prefers less than IP-address lookup is cell tower based location services: Cell Tower Triangulation, which the device doesnt have to have a cellular connection to. In fact, you dont even necessarily have to have a subscription to cellular service. The device uses the distance, direction, signal strength, etc, to one or more cell towers that it detects, to determine your location relative to them. Again, this method only works with models and devices that have cellular capabilities.
The more technologies at play, and if you have a direct internet connection with which to look up data, the more accurate your location can become.  Nothing is more accurate than GPS, but there is still something called Assisted GPS (A-GPS) which uses the internet to help determine time (and location) to help get better fixes on GPS satellites. This not only improves accuracy, but it makes the whole process faster.
Unfortunately, there doesnt seem to be a way to prevent websites and apps on the iOS from collecting your location information without forfeiting the usefulness of location services. I would prefer passive location services which determine my location without sending it over the internet when it can.  Apple promises anonymity, but also warns you that they have no liability for third-party apps violating your privacy.
If you live in a city, I highly recommend getting a smart touch device like the iPod or iPad. Ive heard that the new iPad 5 will have GPS.  I have had an iPod Touch for a couple of years now and its wonderful. Its a small computer/calculator in my pocket that provides me with maps, bus schedules, and internet.  In the city, there are WiFi signals open to the public EVERYWHERE.  I would rather spend $400 on a Touch (and $90/year on Skype's internet-based telephone service [useable on the iPod with a free Skype app]) than get a free iPhone with a two-year $100/month contract. Ridiculous. The only difference is the GPS, and you can get a separate GPS device at amazon.com for $40 if you really need two-inch precision that badly."|Q: Do location-aware apps work on the iPod touch?

The green rectangle is an inserted shape.  I'd like to use that as a title bar basically and put text on top of it.  The other thing, I'd like to be able to do create a ""title"" template of sorts and whenever I need a title page, insert that template page and go from there.
How do I do this?

A: When you have a Pages"|"document, you can always go to File -> Save as Template
After you’ve saved it, whenever you chose New -> From Template Chooser, you have a small section that says “My Templates”:

Your “Custom” templates should appear there.
For the second part of your question, what you need is what Pages call a section. The steps for creating a new section are pretty straightforward and you can find a lot of information on google, see samples here and here (find the part where a new section is created).
In short: Insert a “Section Break”, edit it, change the styles, add what you want (see the links to see tips about different things you can do, like having a different ‘first page’ than the rest, etc.).
Once you’re happy with your “section”, make sure the ‘caret’ (cursor) is blinking in any part of the section and go to Format -> Advanced -> Capture Pages:
The result is a sheet dialog like this:

Give it a name, make sure it includes the pages you want (1, 2, 3 or all, depending upon the complexity of your idea, in your case it would be ‘First Page Only’) and finally save the document as a “Template”.
The page(s) you’ve used to create a Section can be safety deleted before you save the template (unless you want your template to always start with those pages by default), because you have captured them as a section, they will always be available under the new template."|"document, you can insert a shape by going to the Insert menu and choosing Shape. Then choose the green rectangle from the list of shapes. Finally, choose the Text tool from the toolbar and choose a font, size, and color for your text.

93||"Q: Why do local network hostnames resolve only in certain cases?  I have a linksys router which runs ""tomato"" Linux and serves as the local DNS server. It runs dnsmasq.
I recently upgraded from OS X 10.4 to 10.6. Since then, resolution of hostnames on my local network works in some cases but not others. Previously, this all worked as expected.
Here's an example:
tesla:~ cell$ ping watt
ping: cannot resolve watt: Unknown"|"host

tesla:~ cell$ ping watt.local
ping: cannot resolve watt.local: Unknown host

tesla:~ cell$ ping -c1 192.168.42.1
PING 192.168.42.1 (192.168.42.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.42.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.659 ms

--- 192.168.42.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.659/0.659/0.659/0.000 ms

tesla:~ cell$ host watt.local
watt.local has address 192.168.42.1

tesla:~ cell$ host watt
watt.local has address 192.168.42.1

My guess is that the host command is querying the DNS server directly, whereas ping and any GUI apps (ie. Safari) are using some sort of Mac DNS resolution routines, which are not working properly.
Please let me know if there's any other info I should provide.
Edit: included pinging ip directly in above example
Edit 2: My domain is using .local

A: If you're serving .local via unicast DNS (instead of multicast DNS, as specified in this draft internet standard), include an SOA record for .local; as of v10.6, OS X detects this and switches .local resolution to unicast DNS.  Earlier versions of OS X have other methods of forcing unicast resolution - see Apple's KB article #HT3473 for details.

A: solution: don't use '.local' as your domain name.  lame."|"Hostname resolution works as expected when resolving the hostname of a device directly attached to the local network (i.e. tesla:~ cell$ ping watt works).

where you can find other shortcut and how must change it? for example if I change the cmd + O to enter where can I go? is there any software that can do it for me or I must do it in terminal (How?).

*

*I check and in snow leopard I don't have this file.

*How can find general shortcut related to which apps? like capture image or copy & pase or ...


A: The shortcuts for each application can be easily changed in the very preference menu you mentioned.
Which shortcuts can be changed is determined by what options are in that application's menu. So for Finder, you can customize ""New Finder Window"" and etc. etc. whatever is in the menu. 
To change the shortcut for ""Open"" (which happens to be Finder -> File -> Open in the menu) you go to the System Preferences"|"Keyboard Shortcuts, go to Application shortcuts, find ""Finder"", press the ""+"" button, and add a new option with name ""Open"" (exactly spelled as the menu option) and enter a keyboard shortcut.

Note that you can't use the enter key or anything: you can only use the modifier keys (shift, command, control, fn) and numbers or letters.
For general shortcuts you can scroll up into ""All Applications"" and add a shortcut for ""Copy"" or ""Paste"" or which will toggle for whichever application has that menu option in its menu.
EDIT: Response to comments:
1) If you can't find the exact name of a menu command or if there isn't a menu command... well, you just can't set a shortcut unless you use some kind of a third party application that intercepts keystrokes (kinda like AutoHotKey but on Mac). Thus for Quick Look, it doesn't work since the menu command (there is a menu option for it in Finder File->Quick Look) adds the name of the file to be ""Quick Looked"", e.g. ""Quick Look 133.png."" I believe in Leopard it may have worked if one just set ""Quick Look"" to whatever shortcut under Finder, but it doesn't work in SL for me.
2) Screen Capture Cmd+Shift+3 is universal: it's a full screen screenshot. Cmd+shift+4 is similar except it lets you select a box to screen shot. I'm not sure what you mean which shortcuts are for which apps... Either it's listed under the app (in the preferences) or it's universal and applies to either every application with the menu option or the system itself.
EDIT 2: I'll add even more when I have time
a) To my knowledge CUSTOM keyboard shortcuts are stored in com.apple.universalaccess.plist and com.company.application.plist (e.g. com.apple.finder.plist) located in the ~/Library/Preferences folder.
com.apple.universalaccess.plist lists the apps with custom shortcuts:

com.apple.finder.plist lists the actual custom shortcuts for finder under NSUserKeyEquivalents:

EDIT 3:
b) I believe that the default shortcuts for Cocoa apps are stored in the nib files, for example ../Finder/Contents/Resources/English.lprog/MenuBar.nib or seomthing like that. I've successfully edited these nib files MANUALLY using interface builder to change the keyboard shortcuts for the menu bar items. (Whether there are shortcuts that are not menu bar items and not defined by the system I don't know) Thus I don't know of any command line way either...
The nib:

I don't know whether this serves your purpose well. As a side note, for completeness, to edit a compiled nib file like those of finder... is an entirely different answer on its own. This article sums it up well. Basically you work with an uncompiled nib to edit a compiled nib: If you undertake this journey and have trouble finding an uncompiled nib I've uploaded one here.
If I ever find a command line method or learn more about where applications store keyboard shortcuts I will update this answer accordingly.
EDIT: Final Note
These nibs are in xml format or something and can be opened by text editors... that might allow for... I don't know. :D"||0.0|0.0

A: There are two ways to approach this question.
From the end user's perspective, the answer is no. No matter what you do, the app will come back to the same state it was in previously, unless you close it from the"|"switching interface.
Technically: yes. When the device runs short on RAM, it will freeze the application's state from RAM to the main storage (flash). When you resume, it loads the state from flash back into RAM, and then resumes. This is intended to happen quickly enough and transparently enough to be indistinguishable, but you may sometimes notice that resuming takes a bit longer if you have loaded several other apps in the meantime (and therefore pushed the app out of RAM). 

A: They aren't really ""in memory,"" more like cached to disk if and when necessary. Many apps don't even use the multitasking or aren't setup for it. When you switch it does actually close the app.
Being in the task bar doesn't guarantee that it's actually in memory, actively running, or both. The OS manages that. 

A: No. Even restarting, complete power down and power up, will not remove the background applications from memory. According to the Apple Geniuses you must manually remove the applications from the task bar."|"Q: Does the iPhone close the background programs if it runs out of memory or battery?

A: Each Mail account on your iOS 4+ device is able to sync notes. When you have it enabled for multiple mail accounts you're able to have notes stored in different accounts. The Default Account setting will be for which account the notes are associated with unless you say so otherwise (Identical to the Default mail account in terms of functionality).

111||"Q: Aperture .aplibrary file is 3X (!) larger than the photos it points to I'm experimenting with aperture, and it seems the preview and thumbs file is 3x (Three Times!!) larger than the actual photos in the album.
Basically, I have a folder with ~ 2.61 GB (~12,000 images) images in it, predominantly jpg files. It is on a network drive. The .aplibrary file is 7.52 GB.
I am importing it in-place, so as to enable other computers on my network to access the files as well, and in an apparently misguided attempt to prevent the local library from taking up too much space.
To clarify, the .aplibrary does not even contain the original images, as the images are imported without moving.
Looking inside the .aplibrary file, ~60% of the size is coming from the AP.thumbnails (4.9 GB) file, which seems strange as there are also thumbnails stored separately (In the /Previews/ folder).
I have changed the preview quality settings to 2 (out of 10) with little effect on the size of the aplibrary file.
This seems so ludicrous that I've actually completely deleted the local library, and re-run the import process several times, with no change. I can"|"only think I'm doing something wrong, but I don't see any settings aside from the above mentioned preview quality which would affect this.
I'm on a mac-mini with a 320 GB HD, and am eventually hoping to import my full library, which is ~280 GB, so this is a serious deal breaker.
Further Info -
I decided to see what would happen if I manually removed the AP.thumbnails file. I opened the .aplibrary package, and simply removed it.
On restarting Aperture, everything seems to still work fine, though the thumbnails do load slightly slower.
This reduces the .aplibrary to 1.49 GB, which is at least smaller then the actual library files, but is still absurdly large.
What the heck is going on? 

A: Given your 12,000 images are 2.61 GB in total, they're about 228 kB each — is this right? and is this typical of your entire 280 GB of photos?
By default, Aperture makes previews and thumbnails to speed things up, based on the assumption that your images are quite large (e.g. 2+ MB) and loading + displaying them will take a long time.
For low resolution cameras, Aperture wastes quite a bit of space (relatively speaking)... but you can improve it somewhat...
Disable/shrink previews
If this size is typical of your entire library, you should probably disable the automatic creation of previews since they'll be pretty redundant for 228 kB images:


*

*In Aperture Preferences, go to the Previews tab and uncheck the box for automatic generation of previews for new projects

*In the library, click on Photos (at least in 3.x, in older versions you may need to make a search for all photos?), select all, click ""Delete Preview"".


If you really want previews, but want them lower quality/size, then change the settings in Preferences and then make sure you select all photos, right click and ""Update Preview"". You might need to delete them first if it says they're already up to date.
Not much you can do about thumbnails
According to this apple article, Aperture thumbnails are 1024x768 resolution JPGs, and I know of no way of disabling their creation. For low resolution images, this is obviously pretty silly/redundant, since the speed-up will be minimal. Other than complaining to Apple (that ""fixed size thumbnails even for low resolution images is stupid""), I'm not sure what you can do here. :(
I have a library of 34,000 photos which has produced 22 GB of thumbnails, an average of 680 kB per thumbnail. For your 12,000 photos 4.9 GB of thumbnails its about 430 kB per thumbnail. This overhead doesn't really bother me, because my 12 megapixel JPG images are 2-5 MB each (and RAWs are more like 20 MB), but for a library of smaller (say 2 to 5 megapixel) images, the thumbnails aren't that much smaller than the masters...
Just a warning, that according to posts like this one, Aperture will slowly regenerate your thumbnails, so while you can delete them to save space, they'll slowly come back.
If you've only tried with your smaller photos from an older camera, and your newer one has bigger files, then you'll see a big improvement in the amount of space ""wasted"" in thumbnails once you put the larger photos in. 280 GB of 288 kB photos seems unlikely (1.3 million photos?!) so I'm guessing you've got some much larger images in there... in which case it might be okay in the long run...
Should be easy enough to calculate the Aperture thumbnail waste from the total number of images multiplied by about 500 kB per thumb."|Q: I've been experiencing the same issue with Aperture.

*Envirophone (offering £160 currently)

And not only do you have to pay eBay fees (listing + 10% of final sale price)  but you'll probably have to pay paypal fees as well. After these fees I made about £190. Caveat venditor.
If you can get similar from one of the recyclers then I'd recommend. I've used both Mazuma and Envirofone before with no issues.

It's a known bug (for quite some time, now). When installed, you can no longer have the Windows partition in the Startup Disk prefpane.

A: You shouldn't have to eject your Bootcamp disk from your Desktop. As soon as you do that, it's unavailable to the system until you reboot.
A quick tip: if you don't want your Bootcamp drive to display on your OS X Desktop, boot into windows and then rename your C: drive to a name that starts with a period. OS X will treat it as a ""hidden"" file and not display the icon. Been using that trick since Bootcamp was in beta and have never had a problem with it.

OS X has both ipfw, and the application level firewall.  
The appfirewall does not seem to stop things from going out.  It stops connections to the system.
Ipfw does take precedence over the application firewall, apparently.  
My SOCKS5 proxy is set up on a port, and I then give  that  port to in a network Location as the SOCKS5 proxy.  This works fine.  As I see it, programs should not get a choice about using the proxy, and indeed, if I turn it off, browsers can not access the web.
Linux and *BSD's do not have the various ( quite nifty ) things that OSX has in this regard. For them, it would be ipchains and ipfw, respectively.  
I think I'm missing something.  It should just work.  

A: Assuming that ssh is running on localhost (or another machine on the local subnet), the easiest thing to do is to shut down your routes so that nothing can get outside.  netstat -nr will show you your current routes.  Mine looks like this:

*Learna about sRGB color profile, which was build for CRT monitors back in the day. Many browsers don't support embedded color profiles for images (Safari does support, though), which means they'll render uncalibrated, which means they'll be rendered in your (and other visitors') monitor' profile, which might be close to sRGB.

*Calibrating with Mac OS X build-in software calibrartion is possible but might require several iterations to get right. If your display has non-LED backlighting you should let it work for about 10 minutes before calibrarting or otherwise judge its colors, while the lamp warms up.

A: One real easy way is to use unzip on the command line.

*

*unzip zipfile.zip

2) If the ZIP file does contain a folder hierarchy, but you still want to extract everything in the same folder (usually not a good idea, as the hierarchy is there probably for a reason), do the same thing as above, but with -j modifier for unzip, which means ""junk paths (do not make directories)"":

128||"Q: Can I use an iPad effectively without a computer to dock it to? I'm interested in buying an iPad, but I'm trying to understand what the implications are of not synchronise/docking it with a computer. I only have Linux (Ubuntu) machines these days; I have nothing running Windows or MacOS. As far as I understand, there is no official support for Linux (I am aware of libimobiledevice, but would like not to rely on it).
I'm used to my HTC Desire, which is able to synchronise most things I care about (IMAP, Google Mail, Google Calendar being three key ones) over the air, and I'd like to work this way with the iPad. When folks speak about the iPad, there seems to be a lot of talk of docking it with the computer, but I'm not clear why this would be needed/desirable. Can iPad apps typically sync over the air? I've seen reference to MobileMe, but that implies that this facility is not built in and may cost extra.
What do I lose by not docking/syncing the iPad to a computer? Can I do that - buy it and use it indefinitely without docking it? Will I lose any major functionality?
Thanks.

A: Andrew,
The iPad and iPhone can do all the important things you mention you can do with the HTC Desire (Gmail, Calendar, IMAP mail) in several ways:


*

*All email accounts (gmail, IMAP,
exchange, POP) are all equal players
in the Mail app, you just need to
set them up and you can google the
instructions for how to do it
directly on the phone.

*Calendar is similar, with the
exception of exchange accounts (they
provide both email and calendar in
one setup)

*You can install and update apps
directly on the app


What you will miss if you don't connect to iTunes"|"desktop application:


*

*Music and Video cannot be synced
to the device for the iPod app.  If
you can live with purchasing iTunes Store music and videos (or youtube/last.fm/Pandora), then no biggie.

*Photos sync using iTunes as well,
but you can also theoretically use
the camera sync tool to pull off
your camera (or card) directly into
an iPad.

*No backups of your device (I'd miss
this feature).  You can't do online
backups of your iOS profile, but
only with sync and only with iTunes.

*No SW updates.  This will be
noticeable when iOS 4.x for the iPad
is released, which gives
multitasking and folder management.


I'd say, all in all, even without a desktop, the iPad is a useful device.  I got a while back and my parents have latched on to it, and they don't sync but it fills all their needs.  I sync it every week or so to do backups and OS updates as necessary (last month it hasn't seen iTunes at all, and it's doing fine)

A: If you get a 3G iPad, I think the 3G data plan has to be activated through iTunes.  If you get Wi-Fi-only iPad, this isn't an issue.
Note that you can probably get by if you have a friend with a Mac or PC who will let you sync once in a while for these rare needs.
Syncing is also useful for these needs:


*

*Backup

*Transferring photos (although you can e-mail them instead)

*Syncing calendar and contacts

*Getting music, videos, and books from iTunes Music Store (you can d/l songs over the air, but I think the other media types have to be done through desktop)


But if you don't need those areas of functionality (and many people won't), then you won't miss syncing.  Basically, if you don't expect to use Apple's built-in apps, you won't need sync.
MobileMe is really only useful if you have a Mac or PC.  It makes it easy to sync calendar and contacts across multiple machines over the air.  A few third-party apps use it as well, but not many.
Third-party apps typically sync over the air, because Apple's sync is not very open to third-party developers.
FWIW, since getting my iPad, the only time I turn on my MacBook is when I want to backup/sync purchases or charge my iPad.  I'm not saying that the iPad is a complete substitute for a laptop, but it is definitely a useful device all by itself.

A: @torbengb
I remember using Exchange facility on iPhone to integrate Google's calendar into iPhone's calendar, over the air.  Suppose this is not possible on the iPad?

A: Since you're an Ubuntu user and already own an Android device, you may be better suited waiting for a good Android tablet.  I know there isn't anything out there right now that can compete with the iPad, but if you give it 6 months, there may be something that will fill your needs (read: wants).

A: Have you considered running a virtual machine? I did that with my Zune for a while when I cut my nasty Windows habit. You could install Windows in VirtualBox and just use it to sync the iPad with iTunes or Wi-Fi Sync. . . depending on whether it's worth the hassle to you. This way you could still do your backups and get SW updates.
Also, from what I recall, there are ways to sync iDevices to Ubuntu. Rhythmbox and Amarok are ones I can think of off the top of my head.
You can also check out this article. Says 10.04 supports iDevices OOB (but you said you'd rather not depend on libimobiledevice) 

A: I find that Dropbox greatly increases my ability to rely solely on my iPad And iPhone for long periods without using my desktop or laptop. I can get source code, word or PowerPoint documents,and edit them all on my iPad. Then save them all back to Dropbox.  No need to use iTunes synch.  I cannot compile, but I can use LogMeIn to do so on a desktop when needed.  It is really nice not having to pop open a laptop and worry about its battery.  Of course, I don't have an Air.  But. The iPad is pretty powerful by itself.  

A: You might have more success if you jailbreak it, in which case usage patterns Apple didn't think of (such as using it w/o iTunes, or wi-fi sync) become available.

A: Of late, the way iOS has matured with the continual release of new iPhones and iPads, it is entirely possible (and quite common) to set up and use an iPad without docking it to a computer.
It started with the release of iOS 5 when iOS devices became PC free (iTunes/USB no longer needed to activate new devices via a computer). The iOS software update also started getting offered as OTA (over-the-air) updates.
A majoring of casual users these days use an iPad as their primary computing device without owning a PC/Mac. 3rd party apps have evolved as well and there are apps available on the App Store for every conceivable need by almost every major vendor. That makes managing things like email and calendar a breeze. More and more website are now touch-screen/tablet compatible, and all major browsers are now available natively for iPad.

*

*buy a bigger disk (go to Apple store

*backup itunes library and then just nuke


I've looked around on apple's site and on some other pages about backing up iTunes and it doesn't seem like #2 is easy to"|"do from within iTunes. The full iTunes backup (#3) is more straightforward, but I think a full initial backup will take a couple dozen DVDs. 
The hurdle for buying a new disk is the cost plus the downtime while the Apple store is performing the installation and copy.
Are there other, better options that I've missed? Has anybody done any of my suggested options?

A: Regarding option number 1, the Apple Stores do not do hard drive upgrades.  You will need to take it to an authorized 3rd party or if it is a recent model MacBook Pro i would recommend just doing it yourself.  It is fairly easy and iFixit has a step by step guide on their site http://www.ifixit.com/Browse/Mac.  A 500gb hard drive should be relatively inexpensive on newegg.com or amazon.com, and i would also recommend going with a 7200rpm.  
I upgraded my late 2009 13"" MacBook Pro to a 320gb 7200rpm Western Digital drive from newegg and have been pretty happy with the performance.
For option number 2, all you have to do is drag the tv show out of itunes and on to another drive.  Once it is transfered you can delete it from itunes.  Keep in mind that you probably want to keep a back up of the drive you transfer the shows to or else if that drive fails you have lost the content.

A: 
2. move some of the tv shows to an external disk and help him restore when needed

If your boss has another Mac or PC running iTunes, he can set up Home Sharing and move content back and forth from his MacBook as needed. This option is appealing because it's contained within iTunes and doesn't involve manually copying files and deleting/re-adding them to the iTunes library.

A: Do not use DVDs as backup, short or long term. You are much better off using some kind of arrayed disk solution (like a Drobo or something on the network).
Backup (regularly, to an external hard drive) and buy a bigger disk. Which will be more expensive: having a new hard drive installed or simply losing all of that content?

I'm using OS X's built-in Apache server to run the site locally during development. I've set up WordPress and connected it to OS X's MySQL with no problems. The site seems to work fine, and I can post, edit, etc.
The WordPress installation is in a folder called ~/Sites/mysite.dev.
I've also customized my .hosts file and Apache's httpd-vhosts.conf file, to redirect requests for mysite.dev to this"|"folder. So when I enter http://mysite.dev in a browser window, the site loads. No problems here.
So I can access the site, in a browser, from two different addresses, http://mysite.dev, and http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/.
Here's what's weird: When I go to http://mysite.dev, the WordPress site loads normally. When I go to http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/, WordPress can't find any posts from the database: It gives me the ""Sorry, no posts met your criteria"" message (which is built into the theme for when a search for posts returns nothing). N.B.: Apache processes the PHP code normally in both cases -- but in one case WordPress can get posts from MySQL, and in the other case it can't.
My first thought was that this was a problem with WordPress's configuration, so I changed the WordPress URL to http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/, but this made no difference. 
I don't understand why using the two addresses produces different results. Any help appreciated.
(Here's why I care, in case you're wondering: I want to preview the site in BBEdit's web preview window, and BBEdit will only load the site via the http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/ address.)

A: This is not a problem with OS X or Apache. A redirect doesn't change any PHP code behavior and since you apparently get response from the code, nothing is wrong with the server setup. The problem lies in the way Wordpress reads the domain name from the request (which is the only thing that should differ) and what it does with it.

A: I was able to solve this problem—it turns out that WordPress behaves better when I set both the WordPress address and the site address to http://localhost/~Gabe/mysite.dev/."|"WordPress installation.

The last status message in iTunes isn't consistent - sometimes it's copying an audio file from the phone, sometimes it's copying a video file to the phone. 
Any tips for getting past or diagnosing the problem?

A: You seem to have tried all you can really do before proceeding to: 
1)"|"Put the phone in Recovery mode and go from there:

Disconnect your iPhone and turn it off by holding the “Sleep/Wake” button for about five seconds and then sliding the red slider. If your iPhone is already off, there’s no need to turn it on and then off again. Once it’s off, press and hold the “Home” button and plug your iPhone into a Mac or PC with iTunes installed. Keep holding the “Home” button until you see a dock cable pointing to the iTunes icon. iPhones running older software will display a yellow triangle and text which says “Please Connect to iTunes”. Once you see this image, you can release the Home button. 
Open iTunes (if it’s not already open)
  and you will be told that “iTunes has
  detected an iPhone in recovery mode.”
  Click “OK” and you will be taken to
  the iPhone pane. Click “Restore” and
  you’re done, it’s that easy! Depending
  on the extent of your iPhone’s ills,
  it may take some time to do a full
  restore. Once you’re done, you should
  again have a perfectly working iPhone.

2) If recovery mode doesn’t work, it’s time to go to DFU (Direct Firmware Upgrade) mode: 

To enter this mode, plug in your iPhone and turn it off. Hold down the “Home” and “Sleep/Wake” buttons for about twelve seconds. You’ll briefly see the silver Apple logo and then your phone will appear to turn back off. Release the “Sleep/Wake” button but continue to hold the “Home” button until you see a message in iTunes stating that it has detected an iPhone in recovery mode. Choose “Restore” 

It would be good if you tell iTunes to not auto sync:

Another idea is perhaps start with a fresh Library. Start iTunes by pressing alt and create an empty library in another folder in your hard drive. Try to sync from there. please note that this may wipe your phone if you’re not carefully.
If after all this it continues to fail, you may need to go to a Genius bar, but if it’s a 1st gen iPhone, you may be out of luck."|"Q: iPhone sync hangs on 1st generation iPhone I have a 1st generation iPhone which is suddenly failing to sync with iTunes.

A: I"|"just tested it with a couple of different massive projects on my MBP and it created a new file right away.
First guess would be perhaps a bundle or other plugin you've added is interfering with the program operation somehow. You could also try trashing your Textmate preferences file and restart the program to see if that helps (~/Library/Preferences/com.macromates.textmate.plist).

A: Do you have any external drives connected?  Certain external hard drives will go into some sort of dormant mode when they haven't been used in a while, and will block things until they spin back up.  This is triggered by anything requiring filesystem access, whether you're trying to access those drives or not.
If this is your issue, it'll be very intermittent, and caused by other attempts to access the file system (Open File and Save File dialogs being common).  Furthermore, it won't be limited to just Textmate, but your usage patterns may mean it mostly shows up there.
The solution, in this case, would be to unplug the external drives when not in use.

It would be nice if I could zoom into each and shrink the other has I wanted to focus on the slide or the presentation, but just being able to put the two side by"|"side would be good enough!

A: You have several possibilities.
The easiest for you would be probably be using Screenflow. It allows you to record what happens on the screen (the presentation) AND the camera input. It also allows you to do some simple post-production, like focusing on the screen or on the camera.

A: I don’t know if you can do that with the presentation itself (a Keynote document being “played”) but if you can make a movie (hint: in Keynote you can record your presentation) of the slides (so they become a Quicktime movie and not a set of slideshows), you can later use any movie edition software (not iMovie) to create the desired effect. 
An expensive but very powerful one is BoinxTV. It’s really powerful and easy to use, but doesn’t support using a keynote as a source, only different types of images, sound and video. 
Of course Final Cut (pro and express) would be able to do that too.
As good as these solutions may seem, they are not real time, in a sense where you can be giving the presentation while you receive a live video feed of you being recorded and dynamically decide to “zoom” into the slide. That is much more complex.
Now if you can edit and post-produce the slides and you giving the presentation, those tools will probably suite you."|"side would be great. I am using Keynote but would prefer Powerpoint if it has this capability.

141||"Q: How can I Open Multiple Customized Terminal Shells? How can I customized Terminal so that when I open the application it opens several shell tabs?
If possible I would like to also have it run a different environment script for each tab. 
Example: Run this command source bin/activate which is a Python virtualenv setup command. 

A: Add this to your ~/.bash_profile if you use bash or ~/.zshrc if you use zsh, changing the content of the COMMANDS array:
function openterms() {
    COMMANDS=(""source bin/activate"" ""add another here"" ""continue likewise"")
    for command in $COMMANDS
        do osascript -e \
        ""tell application \""Terminal\"" to do script with command \""$command\""""
    done
}

Now calling openterms in a shell will open all the other shells you wanted.

A: I'm using Keyboard Maestro. I once recorded a macro that sets up Terminal (I'm using iTerm, but it doesn't matter) the way I like and made this macro to be triggered by launching iTerm.
So when I launch, it is set up as I"|"wanted. Two windows, five tabs in one for different folders with each Tab named appropriately, and another window with two tabs connected to my server, one of them launches a monitoring script. All of this is done within 2 seconds that the Terminal is launched, which previouosly would take a minute or more.
Now I'm not that afraid to close iTerm if I need since I can reopen it at the same state without any effort.
By the way, Keyboard Maestro is good for many other things too. I recently bought it with discount on mupromo.com, where I've discovered it for the first time but it's worth its full price, too, in my opinion.

A: As Josh K mentioned, you can create a Window Group for opening one or more windows with specific layouts and appearances. In addition, ""settings profiles"" (Terminal > Preferences > Settings) can specify a command to run when a terminal is created with that profile. You can create a separate profile for each command you wish to run, then create windows with those profiles. When you save them to a window group and open them again, those commands will run in their appropriate windows. You can even have Terminal open a specific window group at startup.
As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, there are several new improvements in this area:


*

*Resume will automatically restore windows that were open when you quit Terminal, so using a window group for this is no longer strictly necessary (although they allow you to re-create a specific setup if you've closed the windows).

*If you create a new terminal using Shell > New Command, since Terminal knows what command you ran, it can restore it by running it again. Terminal will now automatically restore ""safe"" commands† when Resuming.

*Terminal will also restore these commands if you save these kinds of terminals into a window group. In addition, when saving a window group, there's an option to restore all commands, not just the ""safe"" ones. So, you no longer need to create a separate settings profile for each command you want to run.
† ""Safe"" commands include anything listed in /etc/shells, emacs, vi/vim, nano, pico, top, screen, tmux, and any command created with Shell > New Remote Connection (e.g., ssh sessions). Note that only top is considered ""safe"" when used with arguments; the others support arguments that may do things you wouldn't want them to without user confirmation, so they are not considered ""safe"" for automatic restoration unless they are invoked without arguments. You can customize the list of ""safe"" commands with ""defaults write com.apple.Terminal RestorableCommands"". The value is a list of strings containing the command names. To indicate that arguments are allowed, add an asterisk after a command. e.g., ""top *"" makes top safe when used with arguments, but ""top"" does not.

A: Alternatively, you can also use screen to open multiple tabs on a single window. screen is very flexible and can configure to run any scripts during the terminal startup.

A: If they can take PDF-X1/a, then they can take any of the others as well; you shouldn't have any problems. 
PDF-X1/a was simply the first in a long line of iterations of a new PDF schema that basically does a lot of preflighting for you (it's one of the best things to happen in the printing industry in a long time). It means your document is ""press ready"", which mainly applies to SWOP presses but can apply to small printers as well.

You can also output press-ready PDFs using the Mac OS X-supplied ""Save as PDF"" button in the print dialog box from just about any application."|"the correct format.

143||"Q: MacBook Pro Memory This relates to my previous question regarding my MacBook Pro. Why is my MacBook Pro quitting and/or failing to start up?
I need to replace one of my 2G DIMMs and in shopping around at Crucial and OWC I notice that they also carry matched sets. 
So, is there any reason that I should spend the extra $ and replace both DIMMs as opposed to just the bad one?

A: From my experience with PC's (not mac's), it's not"|"absolutely necessary that you match your RAM.  However, it's also a bit of a crapshoot because different RAM modules have different timings and voltage requirements, so:


*

*if you use modules with different timings, you'll have to run both modules at the lowest speed or risk instability in the module with the lower speed timings.

*if the modules have different power requirements, you run into the same issue as above.  If you run at the lower of the voltages, the higher voltage module may be unstable.  If you run at the higher voltage, the lower voltage module may be unstable or even fail.
Hopefully someone else can comment on how this applies in an Apple computer since there is no way that I know of to modify voltage and RAM timings.  Note however, that even in a PC, two completely different RAM modules usually work without incident if you match voltages and use the lower of the two modules timings.  Even different voltages will usually work.
I would look for a module that carries the same specifications as your original RAM, at least as far as timing (latency) and voltage are concerned.  If you can find one then I wouldn't be very concerned about using it with your existing RAM stick.  The chances of it being incompatible or causing instability would be very low in my opinion."|usually a good idea to replace both DIMMs at the same time. It's usually not a good idea to mix and match DIMMs from different manufacturers. If you have a matched set, it's usually best to replace both DIMMs at the same time. This is because the DIMMs are matched sets, and have the same part numbers, and are usually made by the same manufacturer. If you have a matched set, it's usually best to replace both DIMMs at the same time. If you have a bad DIMM, it's usually best to replace it with a new DIMM.

*Clipy (open source - https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy)

*Clip Menu (open source - https://github.com/naotaka/ClipMenu)

All the above three are native apps,"|"have search feature, and are really lightweight and fast. I currently use Maccy and before that I had used Clipy which is excellent as well.

Old answer:
Jumpcut is the pure clipboard app. Clyppan is no longer free.
If you do not want all the images you copy to sit in clipboard then Clip Menu can be ruled out and Jumpcut works good.
There's a Jumpcut fork - Flycut. I do not see any difference from Jumpcut, except that it(Flycut) seems to be in, relatively more, active development.

A: I'd recommend Alfred and its Powerpack for clipboard history. Aside from the actual keeping of history, you can save snippets that you use often and call them up with a combination of letters and search among recently copied texts. Alfred's interface for this is much nicer than Jumpcut's in my opinion. I haven't tried any of the others. I haven't found any application to be incompatible with Alfred either.
The price of the Powerpack might seem a little steep for just a clipboard history keeper, but Alfred can do so much more. It has become one of my most essential apps, so give it a try.

A: Two other clipboard managers that have not been mentioned include:
iClip
The simply useful clipboard manager
Stuf

A: I'm quite attached to ClipMenu.
It's simple, yet powerful enough for all my needs. It even supports snippets which are so useful for a programmer like me.

A: If you're already using LaunchBar, it has a clipboard manager built in. It's simple, but works just how I would need it to.

In the past when I've done this, the key never really went back on correctly.
This is the newer Unibody MBP with the black backlite chiclet keys. 

A: If they keys are square without beveled edges then no. Removing it would require major surgery to remove. 
I"|"recommend a can of air duster, some q-tips, and alcohol to clean the keyboard. 

A: Without knowing which specific model you are referring to it would be hard to tell. The keyboards on the newer unibody macbook pros are one assembly and it would not be advised to try to take off the keys. 

A: Yes - all keys on all mac portables in the past 10 years or so are individually removable.
There are very delicate plastic scissors hidden under the key caps. 
Also - the scissors are not necessarily all oriented the same way. The return key may have two vertical scissors where an H key may have one horizontal scissors mechanism underneath. Also - the size of say a small arrow key may not be the same size as a function key at the top.
Large keys such as the space bar and the option keys have added metal supports and you may need a large amount of patience to get them back.
If you damage the very small delicate nubs - you will have broken that key and have to press the little rubber nubbin by hand until you can get a replacement. If you bend the metal rings that hold the scissors (or the actual switch) - the repair cost is much higher. Most lighted whole keyboards go for $65 to $300 plus labor.
Do your research before starting so you won't be that person with a plastic baggie of parts that are close but not identical waiting in line at the genius bar for help with a tedious repair. :-)

In text editors it seems that ⌥+←/→ works, but no dice in the terminal.  I've searched Google and found nothing except a Wikipedia page that claims ⌥+B/F does the job, but all it does is print ∫ and ƒ characters to my terminal (or ı and Ï if I hold ⇧). Any ideas? 

A: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal maps ⌥-←/→ to esc+B/F by default, so this is now built-in for bash and other programs that use these emacs-compatible keybindings.

A: if you know how to use vi you can also turn on vi line editing mode using set -o vi in your .bash_profile or at any time on the command line.  Then you can switch between vi command"|"and insert modes.  So you could hit escape, then use the vi commands for navigating the line:
0 = move to beginning of line
$ = move to end of line
w = move forward one word
b = move backward one word

Once you get to the correct position, you can use the other vi commands to enter insert or append modes, or remove characters one by one, etc.

A: Open terminal, go to preferences, keyboard. On the list you'll find “ctrl cursor right” and “ctrl cursor left”.
Change their assigned actions to “\033f” and “\033b” respectively, and you'll be able to use ctrl+→ and ctrl+← to move, without losing your alt key.

A: This was driving me crazy too, however I didn't want a Terminal-specific fix as I don't use Terminal, and being able to SSH into my OSX box had to use the correct keybindings too.
Also, personally, I didn't care about the ⌥ key as discussed earlier; I wanted to maintain the ctrl+&leftarrow;/&rightarrow; combination that I'm used to on Linux.
To solve this problem, I added the following to my ~/.profile:
bind '""\e[5C"": forward-word'
bind '""\e[5D"": backward-word'
bind '""\e[1;5C"": forward-word'
bind '""\e[1;5D"": backward-word'

Note the first two apply to bash in Terminal; the last two apply to bash in iTerm2 and incoming ssh connections. Don't ask me why the keyboard emulation is different ;)
For the record, I was able to find what the keycodes actually were thanks to a hint from this stackoverflow answer: You can run cat > /dev/null to monitor the exact keycodes sent during a key combination.
(Note that for me, when I run cat > /dev/null and press ctrl+&leftarrow; it produces ^[[1;5D. Your exact keycode may differ, but the first ^[ is represented as \e, as shown in my example code.)
BTW, if you want to see all active bash keybindings, run bind -p.

A: It seems that esc+B and esc+F are mapped by default to go to the beginning and end of words. Although, for my system you can't hold down esc but have to re-press it for each word.

A: You can use the ⌥ key, but you have to select the option to use it as the ""meta"" key:

Once you do that, ⌥+F and ⌥+B will work as you expect.

A: Latest version of OS maps this to Spaces.  Even if you have Spaces turned off, the hotkeys can still get short-circuited in this hidden location:

159||"Q: Best app to switch between all open windows After 4 years of being a Mac user, there is only one thing that I still miss from the Windows world, and that is being able to switch with a single keystroke between all open windows in the computer.
What is the best app or utility, free or not, for accomplishing that?
I've used Witch, but I never was completely satisfied with it. It's a bit slow and the switcher UI is not very pretty.
Do you know any alternative?

EDIT (2016): This question keeps getting views and upvotes after 6 years. When I asked this question in 2010 I was still transitioning from being a Windows user. Eventually, I got used to Mac OS X UI and nowadays I don't use any third party utility for managing app windows, just Mission Control and the native keyboard shortcuts. So, although this question is no longer relevant for me I hope it is useful to new Mac users making the switch (Including this comment).

A: I know it isn't a single keystroke but I like using the ""App exposé"" feature to navigate between the windows of the focused application :


*

*ctrl + down arrow (or three fingers down move)

*then left arrow or right arrow to navigate between windows (or click on the window you chose)


A: I've been using AltTab, an open source application, with success.

AltTab brings the power of Windows’s “alt-tab” window switcher to macOS.

Alt-Tab is open source software that can be built & installed locally, or can be installed directly from its website or through Homebrew:
brew cask install alt-tab


A: I'm guessing you're already aware, but for those searching the web there's always Ctrl+F4. No visual feedback, but it does switch between all windows for all apps (that are not hidden) with one command. Of course it's instant and so it doesn't reorder the list like ⌘+Tab does. I also got tired of Witch, but I decided that most of the time ⌘+` is all I need.

A: Senebier seems to be a good alternative to witch and it's free.
http://www.bicoid.com/app/senebier/index.html

A:"|"https://contexts.co/
Contexts for mac is a competitor to Witch. As a long-time non-mac user looking for more intuitive window switching , I really like this app. It allows for switching between all the windows you have open, using your keyboard or your mouse.
There's also an optional side panel, which is somewhat a replacement for the Mac Dock. It can be configured to hide applications that don't have a window, and displays multiple icons for multiple windows. As such, irrelevant background applications are hidden and multi-window apps can be managed more easily. 
If need be you can still use Apple's Native App-switcher (cmd+tab) to close/switch-to background/windowless applications without using the native dock.

A: *

*Quicksilver (or spotlight). You summon the App you are interested on, say Safari. 

*Using Mission Control's Show application windows (you can assign a shortcut to this using the keyboard icon on the system preferences) 

*Once all the application windows are being shown, you can type (there's no text field, you will just have to start typing) the title of the window you care. After a couple of keystrokes, your window will be selected. 


At the beginning you'll be slow but as time goes by, you'll become pretty fast. 

A: It's interesting - no one has mentioned Karabiner.  it has ton of options for different things, the one I like called ""Tab mode"", where you can switch between apps by holding Tab key and using either arrows or HJKL keys (especially favored by Vim users). Tab+I to cycle through open windows of the current app. 
I love Karabiner, it's the app that made me really, really hate Windows (occasionally I have to do things in Windows). However even with awesome AutoHotkey app I couldn't find a way to use keyboard there as Karabiner lets me on a Mac.
I encourage you to try Karabiner and explore vast amount of different options, trust me - it will change the way you use your keyboard.

A: An app I developed, Optimal Layout (14$), gives you keyboard commands to quickly switch and re-organize windows. 

A: For those who don't know it, Ctrl+F4, Ctl+`, ... can be remapped in:
SystemPreferences=>Keyboard=>Keyboard Shortcuts=>Keyboard & Text Input


A: Command + Tab, combined with Command + `. Works great. 
Let me explain:


*

*Command + Tab : Switch between different applications.

*Command + ` : Cycle between all open windows of the application you're focused on. (For example, if you have four Finder windows open, you can press Command + ` to move between the four windows.)


If this and other keyboard shortcuts seems to be broken, you probably have another keyboard-layout then US, The shortcuts actually aren't to the ` key but rather the key that would have ` on a US keyboard, to find what key this is on your layout, open the ""keyboard viewer"" and switch your layout to US, take notice on where the ` key is located, swich back to your normal layout and you can now use this button to switch windows. 
On a swedish keyboard ` is the button next to 1 (§) on the small/laptop keyboard, and the key next to z (<) on the full size keyboard.

A: Hyperswitch is free and works well. It also looks nice.
Update: ...but unfortunately as of May 2021 the app is not being updated anymore and has no native Apple Silicon (M1) support.

A: As mentioned in the question, Witch ($14) is one of the first window switchers and, IMHO, still one of the best.
I suspect @Sergio (questioner) main concerns have now been addressed in Witch. I think its actually one of the better looking ones, with lots of options for tweaking appearance (including themes). It also feels very fast to me.
All that said, I am not currently using Witch because it doesn't support searching the window names. For that I was using Optimal Layout and am now trying out Contexts (which seems very promising).

A: Been searching for a mac window swapper that INCLUDES MINIMIZED WINDOWS for ages. Little did I know, the function was already built into Quicksilver, sitting under my nose this whole time. It's an action called ""show all windows,"" which I've set as a trigger ( ⌘` for proximity to ⌘⇥).
Quicksilver comes to the rescue once more (as usual).

A: See also this question, where I posted the same answer.
I am surprised / shocked that nobody mentioned hammerspoon. Aside, it can do much more than just window switching!
From its webpage:

This is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.

Using hs.window.switcher one just adds (as mentioned in the docs) to the init.lua
switcher_space = hs.window.switcher.new(hs.window.filter.new():setCurrentSpace(true):setDefaultFilter{})
hs.hotkey.bind('alt','tab','Next window',function()switcher_space:next()end)
hs.hotkey.bind('alt-shift','tab','Prev window',function()switcher_space:previous()end)

and one can happily switch between windows in the current space using alt+tab and alt+shift+tab.

In case it is rather slow, try turning of thumbnails and set the animation duration to 0.
switcher_space.ui.showThumbnails = false
hs.window.animationDuration = 0"|"Q: Best app to switch between all open windows After 4 years of being a Mac user, there is only one thing that I still miss from the Windows world, and that is being able to switch with a single keystroke between all open windows in the computer.

Is there any sort of SuperDrive enclosure that would allow you to put a|"SuperDrive inside of it, and then plug into your computer via USB?

A: Yes, I have this one.  I got it at Fry's in exchange for one by sabrent that didn't work with my mid-2010 superdrive. This new one works just fine with my removed superdrive on 10.6.4, even though the box says it's compatible with basically every version of windows but does not mention OS X.
The one caveat... it comes with a wall adapter for powering the driver rather than a second usb cable. However, I have a USB to male power cable. I plan to remove the power connector and swap it for the connector that is on the plug in adapter that came with the enclosure. The adapter just outputs 5V 2000mA, so I don't see any reason why a straight USB connection wouldn't work just fine.

A: Very useful as a task launcher - I use it much more often than I use the dock.

A: Spotlight shines over more traditional file search utilities because it collects and searches the metadata on files all over your computer. A Spotlight search can look into your email messages from Mail (or other clients if they support Spotlight) while also looking into the contents of a PDF you downloaded and the file names in your Documents folder at the same time. Another example is that you could search on your computer for any image that was taken in a certain location (if you have photos with GPS EXIF data) or say taken with a certain camera.
Turning off Spotlight can be done with some GUI tools (eg. Onyx or TinkerTool System) or directly from the command line using the command sudo mdutil -i off /PATH/TO/VOLUME (eg. sudo mdutil -i off / to turn off Spotlight for your startup drive).

A: Personally, I disable it in favor of Quicksilver.

A: I think Deeper can cover some of setting you want. if you mean by turn off that you don't want indexing if you have other notion with turn spotlight off then this answer is useless.


A: Spotlight will be much useful if you extend it using Spotlight Plugins.

167||"Q: Change Login screen background Is there a way to change the login screen in Snow Leopard?  I do not like the way the purple 'time machine' background looks and can't seem to find anyplace to change this.

A: Tis easy: If you don't mind usig an app skip to the bottom. If you want to do it manually and distrust apps that tinker with your system, continue reading.
There are actually two ways:
1) the way I don't prefer since you may accidentally lose your original background image if you don't back it up
a) change /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg
 - it's that simple!
2) the way I prefer since it's easy to revert to default: it may look complicated, but all it does is tell the OS to look in a different folder for the desktop picture


*

*A “settings” file will be changed. Navigate to “/Library/Preferences/” on the hard"|"drive where OS X is installed. There should be a file named “com.apple.loginwindow .plist”. Make a copy of the file in the same folder, and name it whatever you want: it is a backup just in case something goes wrong. Once again, administrative rights are required. After that, double-click the original file to open it.

*The file should open in either a property list editor or in a text editor. If it opens in a plist editor, select “root” and click “Add Child” (or the equivalent, depending on what plist editor). Name the new child “DesktopPicture”, make it type “String”, and set its value to “/Users/Shared/Pictures/LoginBackground/DefaultDesktop.jpg”. Unless you know how to edit plist files using a text editor , I recommend downloading a property list editor (at http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/development_tools/plisteditpro.html)  if you don’t have one, since it makes alot of business alot easier sometimes. Don’t close the application yet.

*The value of the key you just entered above is the path to where your background file will be stored. Change if you would like. Make sure the system can access the folder (meaning that it can’t be a user folder, only shared folder or some other system location). Now, save the plist file. This may require saving onto the desktop and then dragging it into the destination folder, replacing the original. Hopefully you didn’t delete your backup.

*Navigate to the path/value you entered. If the folders don’t exist, create them.

*Now, just move a picture into the folder with the name you specified in the path (in my case/example, it is called “DefaultDesktop.jpg”) and you’re done!

*If OS X can’t use the picture, it will display a generic blue screen. If this happens, make sure the picture is named right, and that permissions (right click -> get info) are set so that “everyone” has “read & write” permission. If it still doesn’t work, and you want to switch back to default, just replace your edited com.apple.loginwindow.plist with your backup which you hopefully still have. If you deleted your backup, just ask me for the original.
Of course, to do this non-manaully in Terminal: 
sudo -i
defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow \
DesktopPicture '/path/to/replacement/image/file.jpg

There are also multiple free apps out there on the web that let you do this even quicker, including Loginox, NanoCustomizer, etc. etc.
As a side note, if you're not administrator, you may be kind of out of luck.

A: since software update"|"3.0 you can select multiple photos copy them and paste it as email body, in iOS you can SHARE it as email.


A: [I posted this answer to address a followup question that appears to have been subsequently deleted. I will leave my answer up as it does add a more complete details than the prior answer, which was correct albeit terse.]
You can mail multiple photos, but not an unlimited number. I assume to limit the overall email message size, as there could be limits on some mail gateways.
Open Photos app, select ""Camera Roll"" (or other album) from your albums. Touch the ""Edit"" button, and the screen heading should change to ""Select Items."" You can then select multiple photos, then touch ""share"" and select ""Mail"". If you don't see ""Mail"" as one of the options, then you have selected too many photos to attach to a single message. Try just two to see what it should look like. On my phone just now I was able to choose 5 and still have Mail as an option, but if I chose 6, then Mail was not an option.

A:

I'm looking to replace my LG 19"" display with a 24"".
I can't find any screen that isn't overly widescreen, it's ridiculous ! Wide is good but too wide isn't useful, Apple 24"" displays have the screen estate I'm looking for.
Dell used to do nice 24"" (2408WFP) but they don't sell them anymore.
Is there any display out there which shares the ratio of Apple's cinema displays but also cheaper ?

A: How about Dell U2410. I use"|"one at home and it is a great monitor.

A: Samsung P2770HD
27"" and a resolution of 1920x1080. However only 16bits per pixel, so color banding is very visible. I recently bought one cheap. Happy about the size. Not too happy about the colors. 
The Cinema displays can go up to 2560x1440 and has 24bits per pixel, so this Samsung display can only compete on size and price.

A: I'm not sure what you mean by ""overly widescreen"" - are you looking at these screens in person or on the web? How can you tell they're overly wide?
I'd be far more concerned with display quality than display sizing. The Dell screens I've used in the past have always been terrible at getting the color quality that a macbook pro screen has.
I'm currently using a Samsung 2333HD next to my MBP and it's a serious competitor to the apple display quality, in my opinion. To be fair, it's just under your specs at 23"" but it's more than enough extra screen real estate for me and you'll surely be impressed if you're upgrading from a 19"".
The newest apple display is 19.35""x25.7""x8.15"" (and that's for a 27"" screen) whereas the 2333HD is 16.5""x21.8""x8.5"" (for 23"") so very close to the same depth and 3""/4"" less height/width for 4"" less screen size. It's the same 16:9 aspect ratio, so you probably won't be disappointed by the width and, again, you definitely won't miss out on quality. Seems like it runs around $200 these days, I got mine for $150 on sale so you could probably search around a bit for a better price.

A: DELL U2410 is a good choice and new U2412M which use LED as backlight cost less energy."|"It has a 23.8"" screen with 1920x1080 resolution, which is the same size and resolution as the Apple 24"" display. It costs about $120, which is much cheaper than the Apple display. It has a matte finish, so it's less reflective than the Apple display. It also has a wider aspect ratio, so it's better for people who prefer a wider screen. It's a good alternative to the Apple display if you're not concerned with having a display with the same aspect ratio as the Apple display."|0.46538031101226807|0.15647921760391198

A: The main way you would have to go about"|"this is probably using ipfw command line, although I really don't have much experience with it. You could make custom routing rules to do what you need to do.
Some other options:


*

*If the app was trying to use something specificially on that network, it should route that way. As in, if you local network is 192.168.x.x, and your remote is 10.0.x.x, if you try to access something on 10.0.x.x, it should route that way.

*Another idea that comes to mind (Which really just jumps around the problem) would be to have an applescript that changed the order of interfaces when you needed it. Your mac should be using whatever is at the top of the list as its primary network in preferences. If you drag airport up, it would use that as the main network. Maybe scripting this would be easy to do and a quick change when you need to test something in simulator.

To re-download all your apps into iTunes.
   1. First you need to authorize your iTunes. (Store > Authorize Computer)
   2. Next, check for available downloads (Store > Check For Available Downloads)

iTunes will then check for what you have purchased before, and give you an option to re-download your purchased apps.
To see a listing of all the apps you have purchased or downloaded, do this :
   1. Go to Store > View My Account

*T-Mobile's Unlimited $1/day Sidekick data plan - not sure if this is still offered.  Caveats are that T-Mobile will only work on EDGE with iPhone and you need alternate APN settings as well as possibly needing a (paid) proxy to use it

Here's a wiki dedicated to prepaid data roaming, however it doesn't have much information on US (yet)

A: My solution was to activate an iPad MicroSIM and use it in the iPhone.  It required a bit of trickery to get it going but worked like a charm - $25USD for 2GB for 30 days
Activating an iPad MicroSIM from Safari (when you don't have an iPad to use): http://modmyi.com/forums/unlocking-activation/712894-activating-ipad-3g-sim-without-ipad.html

They do offer no-contract postpaid voice, data, and texts through their Even More Plus plans, but you need to set up an account, billing, etc for these plans.
If all you're looking to do is get online, another option is to rent a MiFi. It's a little pricey, but you can use it with your laptop, iPhone, and whatever else you have that has WiFi.
If that doesn't work for you, then it seems that you'll have to either go with AT&T, use Rogers' data roaming, or try to find a prepaid data plan through a regional carrier.

Could you recommend some free programm to record screencast easily, ready to upload to video hosting platforms like youtube?

A: For some reason, it was difficult to find this question, but I'm glad sentinel pointed out the solution I ended up using as well, which is QuickTime Player.

What I'd like to add is how to capture system audio as well. This is in Mountain Lion (10.8).
There's a free, open-source tool called SoundFlower"|"which creates a virtual input/output audio device. After installation, go into ‘System Preferences’ -> ‘Sound’, and from the ‘Output’ tab select the ‘SoundFlower (2ch)’ device. (If your application allows it, you may also change the output device just in the application you're recording.)
Now, in QuickTime Player, open a new screen recording, and click the little down arrow on the right side of the window. From this drop-down menu, also select the ‘SoundFlower (2ch)’ device. Now record as normal.

The only problem with this solution is that you won't hear the application's sounds anymore, even though they're now being recorded. But there's a solution for that too: a multi-output that outputs to both your normal output and the virtual SoundFlower device.
Launch ‘Audio MIDI Setup’, either using Spotlight, or look in /Applications/Utilities/. Click the plus-button at the bottom left of the list of audio devices, and select ‘Create Multi-Output Device’. Now, with the new device selected, check the ‘Use’ boxes for your normal output device and the SoundFlower device.
On the left, expand the ‘Multi-Output Device’ and make sure there's a small clock icon next to your normal output. If not, right click it and select ‘Use this subdevice as the master clock’.
Now you can set this device as your output, either straight from Audio MIDI Setup by right clicking it and selecting ‘Use this device for sound output’, or by selecting it in ‘System Preferences’ -> ‘Sound’ from the ‘Output’ tab. You'll both hear and record system sound now.

A: This can be accomplished with QuickTime Player in Snow Leopard. From the File menu, select New Screen Recording.

Will it try to use the wifi network first and only if that fails attempt to connect to 3G? Or will it always use 3G (with the charges that carries) regardless of other mediums?
Is it automatic? Do I have to manually disable 3G connection if I want it to use wifi?

A: The"|"iPhone will always try to connect to the wifi if it is in range. If it already knows how to connect it will do so automatically. If it does not know it will notify you that there are wifi networks available.  
But to come back to the situation you described:
If it is already connected to the wifi it will use that for all data even if it is also connected to a 3G network.

A: Wifi is always preferred over radio (3G/EDGE/GPRS) so if you want to force cellular data, you have to turn off wifi or un-join whatever networks are in range and/or disable auto-join. There is no failover, so if you get connected to a wifi that has no route to the Internet, the phone won't figure that out and use the cell data.

I purchased a new ADSL modem/router last week (Belkin Share), and can no longer resolve machine names on my LAN to their respective IP addresses under OS X.

My previous modem/router (DLink DSL-G604T) did not have this problem. 
If I look at the DHCP leases on the router, the list includes the machine name, and this coupled with the fact that the Windows machines can resolve IP addresses makes me think this may be an OS X config issue (although I'm not experienced enough with it yet to know exactly what). I tried removing and re-adding the Ethernet connection under Network settings, but that made no difference. 

A: It appears the router doesn't support Bonjour at all (and Belkin support were totally clueless when approached about it), so I've returned it for a refund and am on the hunt for one that plays nicely with Macs.

A: My Airport Extreme does this too. Try adding .local to the ends of the names of the machines you're trying to reach. This uses Bonjour to look up the names instead of your router's DNS, which should work if the computer you're trying to reach is a Mac.

A: Your question is too generic if anything. SIMBL have been the cause of past problems, specially when Snow Leopard was out; the infamous “blue screen of death” that made Windows very famous, affected OS X for a little bit on some machines that had “hacks” like SIMBL (But it was usually caused by APE if I am not mistaken) 
With that said, it’s possibly “impossible” to measure if there’s any performance"|"degradation or “anything else”.
I’ve used SIMBL for a few years and I have no idea if I had run into issues that wouldn’t have been caused should I not have it, however, for the most part it performs ok. There are a lot of plugins already written, one of them being the excellent Total Finder by BinaryRage. I’d say that if there’s a problem with SIMBL, it would be most of the times, caused by a bad plugin that is doing “more than it should”.
With that said, I doubt Apple likes it when it’s time to diagnose a problem. ;)
When you create a Plug-in using SIMBL, there are a few recommendations that a lot of developers do not follow and that is what usually causes the problem. Most notably is the Version Checking. You are “entitled” to make sure that the version of the application you’re going to “hack”, is compatible with whatever you’re going to do. A lot of developers never did this in the past and the results were headaches for everybody.
Suppose you’re patching Safari 1.0. A software update comes and it’s now Safari 1.1 and your plug-in doesn’t work. You shouldn’t try to patch that version of Safari until you fix your plugin. Failure to perform that check caused innumerable failures and rage wars :)
You can try it and if you detect issues, removing SIMBL later is pretty simple.
But after a few long years of having it, I can tell you that it’s relatively safe; with that in mind, understand that SIMBL allows other applications to “inject” code into other Cocoa applications. A malicious user could attempt to cause damage though it. 
You should keep an eye in the SIMBL Bug List to make sure you don’t come across something that affects you and -of course- use known plug-ins and not something that came from “p0rn.com”. ;)
Now if you’re super worried about all you install and do, then stay away from it. :)"|"degradation, security problem, or anything else.

I know I can simply ""open in Safari"" but that's another page load and I loose my place in Flipboard or Twitterific and have to re-open the app.

A: Unfortunately, there is no way for developers to integrate your bookmarks into our apps. We create a browser using WebKit, but the bookmarks are stored in Safari, not WebKit. Instapaper is likely your best choice, and is available in most RSS apps and many Twitter apps do (including Echofon). You then can view these saved pages from the Instapaper app anytime you want.

A: Instapaper is a web & desktop service that allows you to save, on your iDevice, an offline copy of articles or web pages and read them later.

*

*Click on a bookmarklet or other

*The webpage is uploaded to Instapaper's servers

*You use your application to download the offline copy


So, you can see that you do not directly download the offline copy on your device.

A: If restarting and all that doesn't help, here's how i fixed mine.

*Open finder.

*Go to /Applications.

*Drag the offending application to the desktop to create a shortcut.

*Shortcut should have the proper"|"icon.

*Right click shortcut and click on Get info.

*Click on the icon on the top left of the info view. Example:

*Delete shortcut (not necessary).

*Go back to /Applications in finder.

*Right click on the offending application.

*Click Get info.

*Notice the place where the icon should be Top left.

*Click on that location to highlight it.

*Press Cmd+V


You should now see your icon again.
Tip: This method can also be used to change any icon to something else and customise your Mac !

A: For me, the problem was with Terminal.app. It was an app I had set to ""Keep in dock"".  What happened was the icon for Terminal.app started displaying on the dock and in the Cmd-Tab panel as the default icon:

What I had to do to get the original icon back was, while the app was opened, right click on the dock icon and select ""Options -> Keep in Dock"" and remove the checkmark, then I followed the same procedure selecting ""Keep in Dock"" again to get the checkmark back.

After that, I got the familiar Terminal icon back.

A: Strange. I've had this problem for a while, but now immediately after I asked about it publicly, it seems to fix itself. Re-launching the apps brought the icons back. 
Well, I guess this is because I hadn't logged out or rebooted before this for a long time. Logout and/or reboot + relauching each app (once or twice?) was most likely what fixed this.
Thanks and sorry.
Edit: Maybe I was too hasty. One of the icons, that of Spotify, is still missing, no matter how many times I try to relaunch the app. 
Edit 2: I got Spotify icon back too, by removing the app from Dock and then adding it back. Now everything on the Dock looks okay again.

A: You have self answered your question real fast, however, for the record, these are the steps you need to perform in case it reappears:


*

*Logoff/Logon. Reboot if necessary. If it doesn’t fix it, continue.

*Make a backup, trash the Dock DB and Preferences (*)

*Kill the Dock (open Terminal: /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) and execute: killall Dock


The above statement (killall Dock) is case sensitive so make sure you put Dock with the ‘D’ in uppercase. 
warning: Thrashing the above files, will reset your dock and you will likely lose the icons you have (which you will have to happily re-drag and re-arrange), so take a screenshot before all that ;)
As a final solution, try an utility like Cocktail (not free) or any of the free alternatives like Onyx and clear your caches, rebuild your locate dbs, etc. It’s not bad to do that from time to time, especially if you don’t leave your computer on everynight where it can perform all the maintenance.

And"|"my question(s), what part does the Right Fin Stack Proximity Temp refer to?
Is the error given by the Apple Hardware Test considered 100% accurately?

A: This is a guess but I would assume it's referring to the Temperature sensor next to the heat sink exhaust for the right fan.  That would definitely account for your fan running at max... if the sensor is not reporting the temperature, the logic board would likely turn the fan on full blast in order to keep the processor from overheating or even setting the computer aflame.
You might have just forgot to plug the temp sensor in, or left it loose, or it became loose during your board replacement.  Or it could have failed...
Try using a temperature monitoring app like Temperature Monitor and see if it gives you any more info.

A: The best solution is to use the app Macs Fan Control (Free), and setting it to control the fans using the GPU (or whatever sensor usually shows the highest temperature) instead of the malfunctioning sensor.
During start, the fans will run high, but when Macs Fan Control kicks in, the fans runs exactly how you want them run.

207||"Q: Can Numbers ’09 import an Excel XML file? Can Numbers ’09 (part of the iWork suite) import XML files? Specifically, the format created by Excel when exporting as ""XML Spreadsheet 2003.""
I can't just use Excel's native format because the files are generated for our clients by a web app.
If Numbers can't handle these files, are there any other plaintext formats that could be used? I could use csv, but I would prefer to store formatting within the exported file itself.

A: Numbers ’09 supports Excel native format (.xls) but it"|"can’t convert from an Excel XML Spreadsheet. In fact, if you rename it as “xls” and try to open it (trying to fool Numbers), you’ll probably see all the XML but not the actual spreadsheet. Which is more scary than Psychosis II back in the 80s.
Your only bet is some CVS or TEXT format, which excel can even export with Macintosh format for line endings and carrier return (if I’m not mistaken). 
The big drawback is that all format and binary stuff is automagically lost in translation (certain pun intended). ;)
You’ll get the data, but not the format. 
Another alternative is trying to automate the Excel XML to Excel Native format, even if your webapp outputs a XML, you could try to “transform them” before anything else.
For that, I haven’t investigated but you can start with a google query like this. There seem to be some Windows solutions, maybe something you can use/try. 

A: 10 years old but as I stumbled on this post, maybe someone else will too.
The easy way is to view the XML in a browser (I used Firefox), in the Inspector (not source code) you'll find an HTML table. Choose Edit as HTML, copy the table, you can then paste that into Numbers

A: I ended up changing the output to native .xls format by using the PHPExcel PHP wrapper from http://phpexcel.codeplex.com. The files now open fine in both native windows Excel and iWorks Numbers '09.
UPDATE
PHPExcel is now available at https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPExcel but was deprecated in 2017 and is no longer being maintained.
You should use PhpSpreadsheet instead, available at https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet."|"can’t handle files with a lot of data.

I’d recommend to use CSV format instead.
If you need to preserve the formatting, you can use a format that exports the formatting data along with the data, such as HTML or RTF.

208||"Q: How can I sync my iTunes music library between two Macs for free? I have a desktop system that I use as a server. I also have a MacBook Pro that is my main computer. I've done a lot of organization and cleanup of my music library and have it all on my MacBook Pro.
I'd like to be able to keep the music library on my MacBook Pro in sync with the desktop machine so that my wife can access everything from her own MacBook Pro.
I thought about setting up folder actions that would copy the files into the ""Automatically add to iTunes"" folder.  However, since I like to use the ""keep my iTunes library organized"" option, the files get moved into the iTunes music directory and I can't write a script that will compare my MacBook Pro's iTunes music library with the ""Automatic"" directory on the server.
Also, a simple file copy will not sync metadata like ratings and plays. Is there a free, automated solution for syncing iTunes libraries between 2 Macs?  
Below is how I finally did it based on the rsync suggestion:
I used the link provided by James in this answer (but I took out the --size-only option after the first sync): 
iTunes Utility - Merging Libraries
I also took out the --force option (because it's redundant when also using --delete). so my rsync command looks like this: 
rsync -av --delete ~/Music/iTunes/ /Volumes/robert/Music/iTunes > ~/Automation/automator/logs/itunes_rsync.log

I then integrated this into an"|"Automator workflow. Looks like this: Get Specified Servers ► Connect to Servers ► Run Shell Script ► Eject Disk. 
Creating it as an iCal Workflow is screwy for me because I use MobileMe and the iCal event gets synced with my other machines where I don't want this workflow to run.  So instead, I created an agent using Lingon that runs the workflow every 8 hours.

A: It's possible to keep libraries in sync using rsync. Google for iTunes and rsync and you'll find some solutions.

A: How large is your library? Dropbox has helped many people in this situation, and it will work from anywhere.

UPDATE
Do you use only one computer at a time? Are you the only user of iTunes in each computer? Is your desktop a Mac with the same version of iTunes?
If so, observe this scenario:
You backup your desktop's ~/Music/iTunes folder and then delete it. You then copy the entire ~/Music/iTunes folder from the Macbook Pro to the desktop.
You have your laptop out of the house. You rip a new CD or download some tracks from iTunes or Amazon.com, etc. (but put a copy of the new song files aside in another folder temporarily), then listen, rate songs, etc. all day. Then when you get home, you copy the new files to the Automatically Add to iTunes folder on the desktop and iTunes does its magic of organizing the music files (just like on your Macbook Pro!) Then you replace everything inside the ~/Music/iTunes folder on your desktop with what's on your Macbook Pro EXCEPT the ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media folder (where the actual songs reside).
Voilà!

A: I have not tried this, but would like to some time: Mashduo. I found this via the excellent One Thing Well website: ""A utility for OS X that lets you compare two iTunes libraries, generating a report of songs that don’t appear in both libraries and (optionally) making a zip archive of the missing tracks.""
Sounds like some manual work, but may be another approach to achieve what you need. 

A: Soon iCloud will do this for you w/o all of that trouble.  Just connect up the libraries and presto (in theory).

A: I haven't tried this yet (although I am going to soon) but I believe the newest version of Dropbox has a lan sync.  So that you can tell it NOT to backup your music over the internet (if it's larger than your plan allows) but keep them synced over the lan.

A: You go to the little tab at the top that says ""iTunes.""
Click it, go to preferences. Then go to Sharing. Then click ""Share my library with my local library."" Then click it to share my entire playlist on other home computers.
and change whatever you want, then you should be able to access your entire library on all the computers that are registered in your home system.

A: I use skydrive, its free and has 7Gb of space.
1 - Create a hotmail or live account if you dont have it.
2- Then go to skydrive.com log in and install the app. (also need to log in the app the first time).
3 - On the PC or Mac, where you have the main music collection (i suggest to gather all your music to the same computer at first), then you create a folder for your music inside Skydrive's folder and past all your music there.
4 - Then on itunes (reset itunes is HIGHLY recommended) go to ""Preferences"" > ""Advanced Preferences"" and choose as ""itunes media folder"" the music folder inside Skydrive. Also check both options ""Keep Itunes Folder organized"", this one is a must for to this to work so both Itunes (or more) can read your musics with no conflicts and the second options ""Copy files to Itunes Media folder when adding to library"" this one isn't a must but extremely useful because helps you to add new music to your collection, with this option ON you can simply drag a music from your desktop to your itunes with the option OFF you MUST put the music on the skydrive music folder.
5 - For the other computers you want to sync the library, repeat step 2 and 4 (dont need to repeat step 3).
This works for windows and mac.
This works OUT SIDE of a home network
Your computer will start syncing the second you turn on the computer just make skydrive to startup with the OS. So when you turn on itunes you will have your music there.

210||"Q: Why is /tmp a symlink to /private/tmp? Why is /tmp a symlink to /private/tmp on Mac OS X? In other words, why isn't /tmp just a regular directory, like on Linux or BSD? I understand how it works and I don't mind it, I'm just interested in the (historical?) reasoning behind it.

A: I have always wondered the same thing. I can't find any documentation to support it, but typically this pattern is used to make it easier to store files on another volume (e.g. hard drive). This allows the drive to be mounted (e.g. attached) into the file system in one place. For example when the drive is mounted at /private and then the folders /etc, /tmp, and /var are then all located on that other drive. 
What I can't say is why this would be beneficial. It is worth noting, however, that these three folders contain ""data"" files such as configuration, temporary, log, transient and database files rather than executable code contained in the /bin, /sbin and /usr folders.

A: As I understand it, it's a holdover from NextStep"|"(which OS X is based on), and NextStep did it to support NetBooting.  The idea was that you could boot from a network-hosted volume (probably read-only, and certainly shared with other computers), and early in the boot process mount a local (writable) volume on /private; as g mentioned, this allowed runtime-modification of /var and /tmp, as well as per-computer settings in /etc.
This isn't needed anymore, as Apple's current NetBoot system uses a shadow disk image to store changes anywhere on the boot volume.  But some programs/docs/etc now assume the files live under /private, so it'd be too much trouble to switch them back...
Update: since I wrote this, Apple has stopped supporting NetBoot, so the original purpose of /private is even more obsolete. However, in macOS Catalina (version 10.15), they've added a new volume split. In this case it's for security rather than to support NetBoot, but it works in a fairly similar way.
Catalina's system volume is mounted read-only, with a read-write volume mounted at /System/Library/Data (analogous to the old system that mounted a RW volume at /private), and ""firmlinks"" making parts of the RW volume appear at their usual locations in the filesystem (again, analogous to the symbolic links that make parts of /private appear at their usual locations). For example, /Users is now a firmlink to /System/Library/Data/Users. The Eclectic Light Company has a good summary.
Catalina also still has the symbolic links to /private; thus, when you access /etc on Catalina, it follows the symlink to /private/etc, and then the firmlink to /System/Library/Data/private/etc

A: Not sure about the historical reason, but OS X always “reorganized” the typical Unix structure. /tmp is not the only thing that goes to /private, it also has /etc and /var. 
Maybe someone with more OS X background can come up with something more reasonable.

A: /tmp is a symbolic lynk to /private/etc so as to maintain clearly separated 2 filesystems:


*

*/    which can be mounted as read-only, to protect it against
any accidental or unwanted modification, and to protect it of being filled with always increasing files (logs and temporary files),

*/private    which can be mounted as read-write, and which hold any directory containing modifiable files.
If you look at / you will notice 3 directories which are similar
symbolic links for this same reason:
cd /
ls -al | grep '> private'

This separation of access between read-write and read-only filesystems
isn't used actually (in MacOS X), but everything is in place to achieve
this security separation.
Some admins are enforcing this security separation by defining a specific /private
filesystem with the appropriate size and appropriate mounting options
(most notably nosuid).

A: Frequently in Unix, identical ways of the same thing are because of historical differences between System V Unix and BSD Unix. Modern Unixes have to support both to be compatible.
For instance, lpr and lp for printing: lpr is from BSD and lp is from System V.
Whether this is the case here, I don't know."|"Q: Why is /tmp a symlink to /private/tmp? Why is /tmp a symlink to /private/tmp on Mac OS X? In other words, why isn't /tmp just a regular directory, like on Linux or BSD? I understand how it works and I don't mind it, I'm just interested in the (historical?) reasoning behind it.

A: The /tmp directory is a symlink to /private/tmp because historically, the /tmp directory was a symlink to /private/var/tmp, which in turn was a symlink to /private/var/db/tmp. The /var/db/tmp directory was renamed to /private/var/db/tmp in Mac OS X 10.3, but the /tmp directory was not renamed to match.
The reason for this is that the /var/db/tmp directory was the default location for temporary files on Mac OS X, and the /tmp directory was a convenience for users who wanted to store temporary files in a separate location. The /private/var/db/tmp directory was also used for caching and other purposes, so it was renamed to /private/var/db/tmp to avoid conflicts.
The /tmp directory is now a symlink to /private/tmp because it's no longer used for temporary files, but it's kept as a convenience for users. The /private/tmp directory is also used for caching and other purposes, so it's a good choice for storing temporary files.
I don't know why the /tmp directory was not renamed to match the /private/var/db/tmp directory when it was moved, but I can guess that it was a conscious decision to keep the /tmp directory as a symlink to avoid breaking scripts and other software that rely on the /tmp directory."|0.40361732244491577|0.1547911547911548

A: Of course a jail free app could prolong battery life, by tweaking into the system, just like Apple could (and like some android apps already do, since android has almost no management restrictions for developers). Couple things that could be done, for instance: killing apps that are known to consume batter life, or maybe turning off the screen when needed in an intelligent way.
But, as you may picture"|"now, it's so much work that I doubt any good app will come along and I don't really know of any that do. Also, from a developer point of view, it'd be way too much time spent researching, testing and doing this for too little result, because this is already one of Apple's primary worries.
Here are few better things to do for prolonging battery life, from Apple's own list:


*

*Turn off push notifications / Fetch new data less frequently / Turn off push mail 

*Turn off Wi-Fi / Turn off Bluetooth

*Use Airplane Mode in low- or no-coverage areas

*Adjust brightness

*Turn off EQ

*Use iPhone Regularly (go through at least one charge cycle per month)


As for Apple Store apps, no way in hell. The app itself won't improve battery at all. At least not ""automagically"". It could work only as an insturctive reminder, at most.

A: Yes - if it's the thing that gets you to change your behavior. Whether you call it snake oil, a placebo or social engineering, changing your perception or spurring you to action is powerful and can shape your world.
No - without you doing something different, using more energy to ""monitor"" the battery obviously leaves less energy for the rest of the things you normally have running.

A: From what I understand, iPhone apps don't have the power to regulate the power consumption of other apps and iOS system processes. These apps sound like snake oil to me.

A: Apple themselves recommend a deep cycle every month:

Be sure to go through at least one
  charge cycle per month (charging the
  battery to 100% and then completely
  running it down).

If the app reminds you to do this every 30 days, then yes, it will improve your battery life. Unfortunately, I've seen some apps that tell you to go down to 20% and then open the app while it is charging. That isn't letting it ""completely run down"", and so, it would do nothing for your phone.
Besides reminding you of doing a deep cycle every 30 days, I don't see how any app could improve your battery life. If anything, it would ruin your battery life by staying running in the background."|"Q: Can iPhone battery apps actually prolong battery life?

A: Seems feasible. The last post on this site says someone got it to work. Do an actual backup (not just sync) though.

A: As I recall, when you first sync your iphone, you will be prompted to do so, so yes!
I'd recommend you to do a sync on your ipod before"|"syncing the iphone.

A: This does not work, just tried with new iPhone 5 and the settings were that of the iPod i.e. no app for messages, calls or any other iPhone standards :s

A: Yes. This is possible using iCloud. As long as you have your iPod backed up to iCloud, then, it will appear under the list of iCloud backup(s) available to restore from. 
When you start your iPhone, and are prompted with the option of where to restore from, choose iCloud. The backup of your iPod touch will appear.  Select that to restore.

A: You should be able to restore the iPhone from your iPod Touch's backup. Backup the iPod touch, then restore from that backup in iTunes. You should be able to select the backup from the list that pops up. Although the iPhone will be restored from the iPod Touch's backup, iTunes should recognize it as a separate device.

A: When I got my first iPhone three years ago (iPhone 4), this worked partially. Obviously, it worked fine. But every now and then the iPhone was not able to receive phone calls any more. The caller did not recognize it because he got the dialing tone, not the busy tone.
I could only solve that problem by resetting the iPhone and not restoring the old iPod backup."|"Q: Can I restore an iPhone from iPod Touch Backup? If I buy an iPhone, can I restore it (along with app data) from an iPod Touch backup?

When I detach the monitor, all the windows move back onto my MacBook's display.  How can I make it so that when I re-attach the monitor, all the windows automatically move back to their position on the second monitor again?
I use my personal MacBook at work where I have the extra monitor.  But this means I need to detach and re-attach the monitor every day.  I have many windows I leave open from the previous day's work, so this is a real pain.
I know about an app called Forget-Me-Not, which is almost exactly what I want.  But I need something that works on OS X 10.5.

A: Slate is free and very powerful, and it does exactly what you want.
I answered this in a previously asked question, but I'll summarize my answer here:

When you plug in your secondary"|"monitor, Slate automatically detects the
new monitor, and all of your windows will be moved and resized just
the way you like them. You can define custom positions and sizes for
all of your applications, including full screen, half screen, and
grid-based.
You can define different layouts based on how many monitors you have connected, and
you can also define keyboard shortcuts for specific layouts or actions such as nudging and resizing windows by a certain percentage.

Try it out! Here is a helpful article on how to get the most out of Slate.

A: I've been using Breeze to remember window positions when switching between an external monitor and the internal monitor of my MacBook Air. It works with 10.5, there's a free demo and it's not too expensive at $8. With Breeze you define window positions and sizes and then you can hotkey them. You can also set positions/sizes for specific applications in addition to the global setting.
Dori, thanks for that link to Stay, I've been looking for something that does exactly that and I'm running 10.6. Thanks!

A: Any chance of you upgrading to 10.6? If so, you could use Stay from Cordless Dog.

A: Just came across SizeUp which is kind of like Breeze but also seems to have monitor management. I have not tested it but it looks decent:
Edit:
Also there is Optimal Layout which is a very full featured tool but also worth looking at.

A: After looking for this for a while, I would like to say that Stay works wonderfully for saving state and position of windows across multiple displays. You have to save your settings for single screen and dual/multiple screens in order for your positions to be saved across both situations. Optimal layout, though a full feature product unfortunately did not save the window positions or set them back when switching between single screen and dual screen. At least I couldn't figure out how to work with it after only a 30-minute attempt. It's possible that it does but in the short amount of time i had to set this up, I was unable to save.
The ability to divide your screens into sections is a really great feature but not the main feature I was looking for in this case.

A: Yes Stay seems to work but it cant shift windows back that have been put into full screen mode. So if you want to maintain a state of full screen items on your laptop, but positioned windows on your external monitor, then unfortunately it doesnt work..
Kind regards, Steve

A: I also like Stay. It works great, and is really simple to use:

How Does Stay Work?
Move your windows to where you want them, then have Stay store them. Once stored, windows can be returned to their stored state at any time by having Stay restore them.


A: You dont need anything.

I've tried iStumbler, but it only gives you information on machines that are sharing with Bonjour.  Anything out there that looks harder, ie. shows samba, nfs, etc?

The real issue here is that I have an external"|"disk drive connected to my router, and I would like to make sure that the samba share I've created on it is working.  Basically I want a port scanner that is user-friendly and will give lots of information about what is really being exposed on the network.

A: Finder by default will show shared folders for most services.
For an more in depth look at what a machine is running you can always port scan the heck out of it. Then connecting is as easy as memorizing proper instructions over telnet or plugging into Finders 'Connect to Server' dialog.
nmap (really sudo nmap) is one of the fastest, most informative port scanning tools out there. It spanks the pants off any GUI for speed and service comprehension. Try something like the the following.
# [target ip] = Ip of the host to scan
sudo nmap -PN -n -sV --version-all [target ip]


A: Just to add more information, OS X has a portscan application since Panther (as far as I can remember). Network Utility (in /Applications/Utilities/Network Utility.app) will do a Port Scan.

221||"Q: How do I restart my iPhone and why should I? Often people talk about restarting an iPhone in the same way you restart a computer.
How do you do this, what buttons do you press?
Also how/why is this different to just turning off the iPhone using top button and then turning it back on?

A: You can restart the iPhone by holding the power button and home button for about 5 seconds (until you see the apple logo pop onto the screen). You may have to do this if"|"the phone freezes, or otherwise becomes unresponsive.
http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/assistant/phone/#section_2

A: Holding down the power and home button for about 5 seconds will perform a hard reset. Restarting your iDevice frees up used RAM. Low RAM is the main reason apps crash, which is why it's suggested to restart your iDevice every once in a while.

A: Pressing the top (""Lock"") button locks the phone and turns off the display. That is useful for saving power and for security.
Turning the phone off can be accomplished by holding down the Lock button until the red arrow button displays saying ""slide to power off"". Turning off the phone in this manner will allow any running processes / services to shut down gracefully. This is akin to shutting down your Mac. Shutting down your iOS device every few days will free up leaked memory and may help it to work better or faster. I shut my phone off nearly every night, then plug it into the wall charger which turns it back on automatically.
Holding down the power and home buttons until the device restarts itself is called a ""hard reset"" and is akin to pressing and holding the power button on a Mac. Restarting in this manner does not give running processes a chance to shut down gracefully and may in fact result in lost data. This technique should be a last resort, not a daily practice because of its potential ill effects."|the iPhone freezes or if you want to reset the iPhone to its original settings.|0.49513471126556396|0.0606060606060606

A: If you are looking for a way to sync and edit notes, then I suggest Simplenote. It isn't a Dashboard widget, but it's very lightweight and all of your notes are saved to a central server that all of your devices can see.

A: AFAIR Organized does what you want (among other things).

A: This doesn't exactly answer my original question either (which is about an OS X dashboard widget for accessing Notes), but it is the most useful note syncing solution I've found so far:

Specifically, you can easily sync Notes with your Gmail account. This blog post gives good instructions with screenshots. 

Of course, in a way, a cloud-based approach like this is even better than having a widget on the one Mac you sync your iPhone with. There's this drawback though:

231||"Q: How well does the Apple Magic Trackpad perform as a mouse replacement? I'm planning to replace my mouse entirely with the Apple Magic Trackpad on my desktop Mac. My work involves lots of typing (both code and prose). I also use Aperture quite a bit for processing photos. I don't play games; other than chess (Yes, it's that sad.)
Is the Apple Magic Trackpad capable of totally replacing the mouse?
How does its ergonomics compare to let's say the Apple Magic Mouse? Better or worse for the wrist.
Is it accurate enough for touching up photos with Aperture?
Thanks.

A: I've found the trackpad to be great for general purpose use (particularly the 3-finger swipe-to-drag gesture and the wonderful inertial scrolling) but I've found it too inaccurate for GUI development work. 
When I'm laying out screens for software development, or creating graphics for said software, it's too awkward to exactly position things with. I suspect you will find a similar problem if you are touching-up images etc.
I've found the ergonomics to be good, to be honest - I mostly use the Magic Trackpad and when that's not suitable for a job (see above) I switch to a Magic Mouse for a couple of hours. I have relatively small hands and find the Magic Mouse to be a really comfortable mouse, with no strain on fingers or wrist even after prolonged use. The trackpad gives you less to 'lean on' but I haven't found myself with any wrist ache"|"or strain even when I've been using it solid for a day, etc.

A: The Magic Trackpad is very similar to the trackpad found on newer Apple MacBooks. It is suitable for most kinds of work. Though it is capable of completely replacing a mouse in function, it is much less adequate, and perhaps even irritating, to use with image editing programs such as Aperture. The wrist motion is in large the same.

A: EDIT: Summary of my answer: It does not perform very well as a replacement for a mouse.
Ymmv I guess. I got into the hype as well, bought it, and eventually put it back into its box and considering selling it on eBay. I'm not wholly disappointed with it, but on 27 inch iMac, I found it to be significantly slower for pretty much any kind of operations, compared to a mouse.
Like you, I was very excited when I heard about it, because I had gotten used to the trackpad on a Macbook Pro during a long holiday. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it doesn't translate well on a large screen. On a desktop computer, you expect to have more control than on a laptop. You have more keys, more space. So no, the Magic Trackpad is not a replacement for a mouse, at least not on a 27 inch screen. 
What I did like on the trackpad, mostly, was the ability to scroll pages in the browser with the double finger swipe. Task switching with the trackpad was always awkward.
Since I still felt I needed a mouse, I also unwrapped the bluetooth keyboard that came with the iMac, and put the trackpad next to it. That way it took approximately the same space as my aluminium keyboard. Unfortunately I found I had more strain in the wrist because I needed to move the arm between the trackpad and the mouse, and using a cushion under the arm moving sideways from time to time didn't work well. Now that is my opinion as well, but I didn't enjoy the wireless keyboard; it felt cheap and light compared to the aluminium keyboard. Typing on the wired aluminium keyboard felt a lot better. Since it was rather cumbersome to try to fit the trackpad in between a large Aluminium keyboard (comes with keypad) and the mouse, I moved the wireless keyboard and magic trackpad back into their boxes :(
That is my honest opinion. I love Macs. I think the Magic Trackpad is a great idea. I even tried gaming with it. I still wish it worked. But it doesn't. It works better in a few ways, but it can not match the prevision and speed of a mouse.
For a web developer who needs to switch tabs, click small things in the window, toggle the Firebug console and all its panels every now and then, switch between gaezillions of windows; it doesn't work.
Perhaps it is still a good choice for people who do primarily typing and editing documents.
This, for me, would be the perfect aluminium keyboard:

This is not a joke. If that space was used as a trackpad, it would be so convenient to do the swipe gestures for scrolling down webpages. I guess it would be just as useful for most other gestures. Unless you are a hardcore ""the vim way"" user, like me you will often use the cursor keys. Since the hand often ends up there, and the home/end/pgup/pgwn keys are hardly necessary on a Mac (think Cmd-Left, Cmd-Right, etc), this just makes sense.

A: I mostly use my Mac to write code and have found the Magic Trackpad to be very well suited for this task. The main drawback is drag and drop can be a little awkward - however, its usually possible to find ways around drag and drop in most interfaces.

A: I can't say I've used the Magic Trackpad, but if you're looking for some of the touch gestures and scroll inertia (which I love), while keeping the accuracy of a mouse, I'd go for the Magic Mouse.  I've been using mine since they were first released and it's served me very well in everything from image editing to web browsing to programming (can't say enough about how much I love the inertial scroll for getting around large documents...)
The one downside to the Magic Mouse (again, can't say if this also applies to the Magic Trackpad) is that it burns through batteries.  Each set of 2 AAs usually lasts me about 2.5 months.  For this reason, I also picked up Apple's rechargeable battery set (6 AAs & wall-mounted charger).  That was about 2 months ago, and I've been happy with the charger set as well."|"Q: How well does the Apple Magic Trackpad perform as a mouse replacement?

232||"Q: How can I move an iTunes library from one computer to another? I'm getting a new laptop and I want to move my iTunes library from the old to the new computer. How can I do this? Of course I want to preserve as much information as possible: metadata such as ratings and play counts, cover art, my purchased content from Apple.
I also own an iPhone which I used to sync with the old computer and now I want to sync with the new one, preserving my apps, contacts, purchased content, etc.
What would be the best way to do this? Is just moving the whole “iTunes” folder from one computer to the other an option?

A: If they both have Firewire you can simply use the Migration Utility.

A: Yes, moving the whole iTunes folder will work fine, as long"|"as the music is in the same location or a subfolder (that's the default). You can even move from Mac to PC and vice versa. However, I would suggest copying first; just in case anything goes wrong. :-)
If the iTunes Media folder and the Library files are in different locations, it can get more complicated. It's still possible, but if this is the case and you have the disk space, it's easiest to “Consolidate” the library into the folder that contains the iTunes Library file before you make the move.

A: Yes, simply coping your entirely iTunes folder to an other computer will do the trick. This assumes all of your media is consolidated within the iTunes Media and iTunes Music folders. iTunes will assist in copying music to the folder and organizing a library if you would like to ensure all the media is portable when it comes time to transfer.
Do not forget to reauthorize the old computer if you are not going to use it regularly in case it crashes and one of your 5 slots is taken up. You can reset things after a lost computer, but it is somewhat time restricted to prevent abuse of that feature.

*The IMAP/CalDav option doesn't have push

*The Exchange option seems to be buggier than IMAP/CalDav


Any other thoughts?

A: Exchange (Google Sync) for GMail lacks some features that you are probably used to--search and cloud drafts. The ""known limitations"" are listed here: http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=139635.
My experience with CalDAV in iCal are that multiple calendars on a single account are a bit squirrely to work with—you won't be able to get each calendar listed by itself under the primary google account heading. The calendars end up in a set of subfolders, depending on how you end up configuring it. That said, I don't know how the same thing would look on the iPhone.
What I do and recommend would be to continue using IMAP for GMail access--there's nothing wrong with it and you don't gain anything by moving to exchange. I do use Google Sync for contacts and calendars since it's the closest I can get to the functionality of MobileMe for free, and I'm very happy with it. For desktop access (aside from the webapp) I like BusyMac (post hyperlink limit reached; Google it) Software's products: one is an iCal superset clone and another is a sync utility that makes your Google Calendars show up in iCal just like MobileMe would."|"Q: What are the pros and cons of IMAP/CalDAV vs. Exchange for GMail and Google Calendar for iOS 4?

I'm running into a situation where I need to repair my main partition but I can not get my machine to boot off the Snow Leopard DVD. It will boot up, let me choose my language, then go to the ""Preparing Installation"" (I think that's what it says) screen just before you get to the install wizard and utilities. After that the screen goes gray and then the machine cuts off, black screen, no lights, no power.

*1067 DDR3

*2.53 Core 2 320 gb HD 

*10.6.4 OS X (upgarded install from the original 10.5)


I'm tempted to just try installing 10.5 fresh and see if I can do the upgrade, or find out how to get a detailed boot from the Ubuntu install disc. 
EDIT: Just as a note, I can boot fine off my 10.5 install disc that came with my laptop originally. I'm just not sure if any changes between then and 10.6 would make using those disk utilities a bad idea. I know the versions are different. Also the memtest utility was successful off the Ubuntu disc, but it just sort of hangs up during the boot process.

A: There should be a point—after you choose the language, but before it starts trying to install the OS—where you see a Utilities option in the menu bar. 

Do you get to this point? If so, what happens when you choose Disk Utility? 
There's more information about this at Using Disk Utility to Repair a Disk (University of Wisconsin).

I have already tried changing the partition names but this has no effect.
Any ideas?
Note: I originally asked this on SuperUser, but upon discovering this site, I asked it here also.
Edit: Here are some related pictures:

The Partition in Finder

Disk Information in Disk Utility

Volume Information in Disk Utility

A: Note that since a firmware update that came in with High Sierra (late 2017) the root of the drive is now a secondary source for the disk label files. The primary source is within a directory called:
.IABootFiles

For example, to hit both sources:
sudo bless --folder ""/Volumes/Install macOS 10.12"" --label ""Install macOS 10.12""

sudo bless --folder ""/Volumes/Install macOS 10.12/.IABootFiles"" --label ""Install macOS 10.12""


A: Unless I'm totally misunderstanding your question, this is pretty simple.  You can change the volume name just by right clicking it in finder, choosing ""Get Info"", and modifying the ""name and extension"" field.  Or slow clicking twice on the name of the volume as it appears on the desktop, and editing it just like any other file name...  I do this all the time with bootable volumes and it works just fine.
Your installer doesn't have to be called ""Mac OS X Install DVD"".  The installer doesn't care what you call it.  Name one ""Crap Bag"" and the other one ""Princess Consuela Banana Hammock""... no one will care and OS X will still install just fine.
edit:
I just tried this with a USB stick I created that has the 10.6.3 installer on it.  I had already changed the name from ""Mac OS X Install DVD"" to ""10.6.3 Installer minus Optional"".  I just changed it to ""10.6.3 Banana Hammock"" and when I booted with alt, that is what was displayed.
There must be something not explained here that is causing this... maybe partition schemes other than GPT don't work this way?
on second edit:
What method did you use to put the images on the bootable partitions?  I ask because I'm wondering if you just copied the images themselves rather than cloning or restoring"|"them to the partitions.
I've never tested this, but I'm wondering if it's possible to have .dmg files that are bootable on a partition.  The behavior that would arise would be in line with what you're describing.  You could change the partition/volume name, but it wouldn't affect the name of the dmg file.  Even if you changed the dmg file name, that wouldn't affect the name of the disk image (volume) contained within the dmg file.
If this is the case, I would think you could change the name by mounting the image in OS X, and then changing the volume name (the name of the volume that shows up on the desktop or in disk utility) that was mounted from the dmg or iso.
edit III
Below are the steps I used to create my installer image.  The main difference is Carbon Copy Cloner.  It may not work any better, but at this point it may be worth a try since mine has the behavior you would like to see.

*

*Inserted OS X Install DVD.


*In Disk Utility, clicked ""New Image"".


*Named it ""Installer_image.dmg"".


*Chose ""compressed"" and ""none"" for encryption, clicked save.


*Once complete, I mounted the image and deleted the optional folder.


*Right clicked the mounted volume, chose ""Get Info"", wrote down the exact amount of space used in the image for files and folders, and unchecked ""Ignore Ownership on this Volume"".


*Went back to disk utility, inserted my flash drive, and made a partition named ""10.6.3 Install minus Optional"" that was about 500MB larger than the disk image's used space.


*Did another ""get info"" on the new flash drive volume and unchecked the ignore ownership option.


*In Carbon Copy Cloner: as source, chose the mounted installer volume, target was the new flash volume.  Chose ""Backup Everything"" and ""Delete items that don't exist on the source"". Clicked clone.
Afterwards, I am able to change the name of the flash volume, and whatever I change it to is what shows up in the boot menu.

A: This is an older post, but I came across it today and figured I'd share what I found.
The 'bless' command seems to make this work. First make sure the disk is mounted, find out which folder it is mounted to, and:
sudo bless --folder <mount_path> -label <desired_label>

For example:
sudo bless --folder ""/Volumes/Mac OS X Lion Install ESD"" -label ""Lion Install""

Whatever you put for the label is what should show up at the choose disk screen when holding option during a boot.
Note that you'll probably want to do this in addition to renaming in Finder or Get Info just to keep them somewhat in sync and make them easier to identify in either case.

A: Do you ever try use rEFit:
rEFIt is a boot menu and maintenance toolkit for EFI-based machines

A: Installer media
devguydavid's answer definitely leads in the right direction, but probably only works for older installer media.
The other David's answer likely works for contemporary installer media, but I haven't verified it.
But what about boot volumes for permanant operating systems or non-macOS installers?
Non-installer boot volumes
To label any EFI boot volume, the bless command must be pointed to the folder containing the bootloader—boot.efi or bootx64.efi—in an EFI system partition (which may be the actual OS volume, or a separate volume dedicated to the task).
The exact location of the bootloader is ultimately arbitrary (i.e., one could move it around by changing settings in NVRAM), but it is typically one of a handful of locations, depending on the OS.
Locate the relevant bootloader
Run through the following conditions for the boot volume you want to change, then take note of the folder containing boot.efi or bootx64.efi.

*

*For standard installations of macOS:

*

*With an HFS+ startup volume format:

*

*boot.efi is in /System/Library/CoreServices on the startup volume.



*With an APFS startup volume format (generally macOS 10.13 or later when the boot volume is stored on an SSD):

*

*The bootloader is stored on the Preboot APFS volume (in the same actual disk partition as the boot volume).

*

*To mount this volume, run diskutil list, look for Preboot next to the name of your startup volume (Macintosh HD or whatever) and then run sudo diskutil mount diskXsY, substituting X and Y to specify the Preboot volume.



*boot.efi is in /Volumes/Preboot/<some-UUID>/System/Library/CoreServices

*

*where <some-UUID> is the longest filename shown by ls /Volumes/Preboot.





*(Source: Booting the Mac: bless, and what makes a volume bootable from Eclectic Light Co.)



*For Linux installations, installers or other live media:

*

*There is no definitive, uniform bootloader location for Linux OSs, but the following location is somewhat likely:

*

*In the EFI partition on the startup disk (the EFI system partition).

*

*Presumably (if you are running Linux on a Mac) you know how to mount this, but the gist is diskutil list followed by diskutil mount diskXsY, substituting X and Y to specify the EFI partition.



*bootx64.efi or similar is in /Volumes/EFI/EFI/boot. (Note that this is technically a fallback location—the actual firmware will likely be somewhere else, and you may have to do some poking around using bootoption as described below).



*(For an extremely informative deep dive into the standard EFI boot process, I highly recommend UEFI boot: how does that actually work, then? from Adam Williamson)



*For Windows:

*

*In the EFI partition on the disk where Windows was installed (mount it under macOS as you would for Linux):

*

*The EFI firmware (which Windows calls bootmgfw.efi) should be in /Volumes/EFI/EFI/Microsoft/Boot.





*Anything and everything:

*

*If you still can't find your bootloader, I recommend using bootoption:

*

*Run bootoption list and find the identifier for the boot entry you want to label. It should be BootXXXX where X is 0–9.

*Run bootoption info BootXXXX as appropriate. Look for a Partition UUID or a pair of Container Partition UUID and APFS Volume UUID. Also note the Loader Path.

*Run through each volume printed by diskutil list with diskutil info diskXsY until you find a matching Disk / Partition UUID or Volume UUID.

*

*For APFS volumes, consult Container Partition UUID to find the actual disk partition. The volume (in the container partition) containing the bootloader has Volume UUID = APFS Volume UUID.

*For all other volumes, look for a volume such that Partition UUID = Disk / Partition UUID.



*Finally, the bootloader is located at Loader Path on the volume you just identified.

*

*e.g., \<uuid>\System\Library\CoreServices\boot.efi, \EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi, etc., etc.







Change the label
OK! Knowling the location of the bootloader, we can now use bless to add or change its Boot Manager label:
sudo bless --folder <bootloader-folder> --label '<new-label>'

This creates the files .disk_label and .disk_label_2x in the bootloader folder.
The reason this process is so complicated is that the labels are actually stored prerendered in an extremely simple image format. This obviates the need for font rendering in the preboot environment.

A: Given that you can't change the name of the disk images, what you need to do is be able to tell which disk image is which. To what you're doing now, you'll need to add one extra step…

*Boot the mini from its internal HD.

Disk Information in Disk Utility

Volume Information in Disk Utility

A: I would recommend using the command line terminal to edit the file system of your bootable volume. You can use the disk utility application to do this as well, but it can be easier to use the terminal.
To edit the file system of your bootable volume, you can use the following commands. Replace the name of your volume with the actual name you gave it.
sudo cp -R /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12/.IABootFiles /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12
sudo rm -rf /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12/.IABootFiles
sudo mv /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12/.bundle /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12
sudo mv /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12/.bundle /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12/.bundle.sparsebundle
sudo mv /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12/.bundle.sparsebundle /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12
sudo rm -rf /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12/.bundle.sparsebundle

The first command copies the contents of the .IABootFiles folder from the Install macOS 10.12 volume to the Install macOS 10.12 volume.
The second command removes the .IABootFiles folder from the Install macOS 10.12 volume.
The third command moves the bundle file from the Install macOS 10.12 volume to the Install macOS 10.12 volume.
The fourth command moves the bundle file from the Install macOS 10.12 volume to the Install macOS 10.12 volume.
The fifth command removes the .bundle.sparsebundle folder from the Install macOS 10.12 volume.

Now you can rename the volume using the Finder or terminal.
sudo find /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12 -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;
sudo find /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12 -type f -exec rm -rf {} \;
sudo find /Volumes/Install macOS 10.12 -type f -exec rm -rf {} \;

I like safari's speed and would like to try it a bit, but the cmd+x shortcut is burned in my brain and every time I use safari I end up screwing up.
I'd like to know if its possible to change this behavior, because this simple thing is a stopper for me.

A: In most native OS X applications, the key presses Cmd-Shift-[ and Cmd-Shift-] will cycle left and right through tabs, respectively. Safari understands these.
If you use something like BetterTouchTool, then you can assign gestures (such as a three-finger swipe"|"left or right) to these key presses, and get tab cycling across most of OS X.

A: *

*To go to the previous tab, press ⌘ Command ⇧ Shift ← Left 

*To go to the next tab, press ⌘ Command ⇧ Shift → Right
Traveller’s note : These keyboards equivalents may be reversed in a right-to-left environment. 

A: To go to the next tab ⎇ Control+Tab or
 ⇧ Shift+⌘ Command+] or ⇧ Shift+⌘ Command+→ Right
To go to the previous tab ⎇ Control+⇧ Shift+Tab or ⇧ Shift+⌘ Command+[ or ⇧ Shift+⌘ Command+← Left

A: In case you are coming from Chrome and want to use 
cmd+[0-9] for switching tabs (instead of cycling through your preset top sites) take a look at:
github.com/rs/SafariTabSwitching

Safari Tab Switching is a Safari SIMBL plugin which allow switching between tabs using Cmd+1-9.

Update:
Safari Version 9.0.2 (El Capitan) has native support for this:


A: Safari 9.0, released today for 10.9 Mavericks and 10.10 Yosemite, along side with the 10.11 El Capitan release, has introduced this natively. 

There are two options. If checked, ⌘-1 through ⌘-9 will switch to tab 1 through 9, respectfully. This will change the original behavior of mapping to the favorites bar bookmark 1 through 9. Those will be changed to Command-Option-1 through Command-Option-9.
If unchecked, while it does not say it, the behavior is reversed. Command-Number will still be the favorites bar bookmark, while Command-Option-Number will be the tab. This flipping of behavior matches the Command-Click and Command-Option click behavior for opening a link.
It's undocumented.

A: Easy!
Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab

A: What about setting bookmarks 0-9 to be bookmarklets that change window tabs?

A: Check SafariTabSwitching.

A: In El Capitan, OSX 10.11, this has been included as a new feature of Safari Version 9.0 (11601.1.50). 
Go to Preferences > Tabs > Use ⌘-1 through ⌘-9 to switch tabs

A: I personally like the keyboard shortcut used in Chrome and Opera: Option+Cmd+(left/right arrow keys). This can be assigned in System Preferences-->Keyboard-->Shortcuts-->App Shortcuts. Press the plus button and add a pair for Safari with the command names ""Show [Previous/Next] Tab"" and then type the key sequences you want to use. Pretty handy. Good luck!

238||Q: How to stop iPad/Safari from treating certain numbers as 'phone numbers'? I've got some pages on an intranet that show numerical rates to 4 decimal places, eg 147.1453. When these pages are viewed on an|"iPad, some of these rates appear underlined and clicking on them causes the iPad to offer to create a new contact, or add to an existing contact.

239||"Q: Do I need a screen protector for my new touch-screen smartphone? With my old dumbphone I never really worried about the screen, but my new iPhone 4 has a pretty gorgeous screen that I certainly would never want to come to harm. So I was wondering how many people out there use a screen protector, and what your experience has been.
Specifically:


*

*Do you use a screen protector for your smartphone?

*Do they interfere with touch-sensitivity of a touch-screen?

*Are all screen protectors created equal? Are there ""good"" ones and ""bad"" ones?

*Are they more resistant to fingerprints than the glass?

*Do they get grimey/dirty/cloudy?

*Are they harder to clean than the glass, or do you just replace it?

*How often would you need to replace it?

*With glass on the back of my iPhone4, do I need one on the back as well? Or is that just stupid?


I guess the most important question is: 


*

*Do they really protect the screen in any meaningful way? Or do they just make you feel better?


A: I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with sebastiaan on almost all points, just to complete the spectrum :)


*

*Yes, I've almost always had a screen protector on my smartphone.

*Sometimes the screen protector interferes with the touch screen.  Depends on the quality of the touch screen, and the screen protector but in most cases you might notice a slight change in responsiveness.
Are all screen protectors created equal? Are there ""good"" ones and ""bad"" ones? 

*Very yes.  Some are just clear stickers, others (like my favorites Invisible Shield) are the same material used to keep dust from messing up helicopter blades)

*Sometimes.  This goes along with the quality of the screen protector."|"But in most cases there will be less fingerprint smudging.

*They can get dirty if they're low quality, or not applied carefully.  Usually lint or dirt will get its way into the edges and start to peel it off.  How well this works depends on the screen protector and the surface you apply it to.  But if you're just covering the screen you should be fine.

*Usually just wiping it on my pants will get rid of most day to day dirt on it.  The big advantage is that if you get something stuck on it, you can scratch it off without worrying about your screen!

*I had a full body protector on a blackberry tour for nearly a year before it started to peel off, and it really only started to come off on the curved surfaces.  I pulled off alot of the body protector, but left the screen protector on, and it's still going strong.

*The invisible shield (I swear I don't work for them) can be bought as a full body kit, considering the shape and material of the iPhone4 I would say it's not stupid.  You want to protect the phone to keep it looking nice, then treat the front like the back, since they're essentially the same thing.


A: *

*No, I hate screenprotectors

*Most of them really don't

*There are certainly bad ones, that are hard to apply or peel off easily, I've even had one that would blur the screen

*Only the ones that blur your screen ;-) They have a slightly matte finish so fingerprints won't be as obvious

*Yes, yes, and yes.

*I suggest you just replace them, they're not that expensive

*I believe it is all stupid...


They just make you feel better. The glass on the new iPhone is incredibly difficult to scratch, and even the older ones hardly scratch at all. I suggest you stop caring so much about a little scratch, the device is supposed to be used. You'll hardly notice it if there even ARE tiny scratches. 
If you want to protect it, what you really need to worry about is the thing breaking after you drop it, try a protective case instead. :-)

A: I did not use one for my iPhone as the screen is glass and hard to scratch. 
I am using one for my Nexus One because the screen is plastic and probably easy to scratch.  Since putting the screen protector on I have stopped using the case.  I am using the Invisible Shield that Alex likes.

A: I would have said no, you don't need a screen protector on your phone.  I've never used one on the iPhone, Palm Treo, Nintendo DS, etc.
Then my wife dropped her iPhone and the screen cracked.  We're going to get her a screen protector now, so she can keep using the phone without worrying about it scratching her.

A: I see that you have marked as an accepted answer. However, there is another proof that screen protectors these days have more essentials than Corning Gorilla Glass that protects well from scratches. As I took some few research, I found some useful benefits why people prefer screen protectors in the following:


*

*Prevents heavy scratches

*Easier to clean fingerprints

*Can resist screen breakage from an impact


Not all the times that glass technology always invulnerable to scratches. When it say ""scratch resistant"" it means no scratches in a certain number of times. Also, like other usual glasses do, it breaks like fragile glass when it falls. You may check the Upgrade Your Life blog post about useful truth about screen protectors, including some video and descriptions and find out what I really mean.

A: The Glass is pretty scratch resistant.   Yes they do protect the screen a bit.   I like my device to be like they designed it.   So do not want to add layers and bult to screen.   My one compromise is that I always use a ""bumper"" cover.   the glass on Iphone front and back is tough, but eventually in a two year that you normally use a phone you will eventually drop it. Cracked glass normally goes with a otherwise functioning device, but it is definately not nice.
I have also found that some covers which are supposed to protect the phone, eventually gets some dust between the cover and device.   Do that and the device will look worse than the unprotected oen in the end.
If you are very disciplined and careful... go naked
If you like me tend to be clumsy (over a two year period) ... get some edge protection.

A: If you get a nice warm feeling from knowing that your phone is mint underneath that scratched scratch-protection then get a cover and/or screen protector. Otherwise don't bother.
I used a Zagg InvisibleShield on my iPhone 3G from the beginning. Result: The phone is scratchless but the shield needs regular replacement. This might be useful if I'd ever sell the phone, but when passing the phone down in the family, it doesn't add value.
Exception: old devices with delicate plastic touchscreens: it's a good idea to use a screen protector here simply because the stylus will scratch the plastic screen. Here, it's a good idea to replace the screen protector every year or so. But today's devices have much tougher screens, and who owns and uses a device for more than two years anyway? (I do, personally, but most people replace their stuff too often to care about short-term wear.)"|"Some screen protectors are better at resisting fingerprints than the glass, while others can be quite grimey/dirty/cloudy.

A: I hopefully have a solution to this issue. I also had this problem, and I believe it's because you have insuffient disk space and iTunes being a large program requires so much disk space to be available in order to perform these tasks.
Therefore, iTunes will bring up the error after reaching 2/3 of the way and then the error appears: ""iTunes could not restore the iPod/iphone 'NAME' because the backup could not be saved on the computer."" The backup you did is there because you're obviously selecting it when ""restoring from backup"".

There's probably a few more I'm forgetting too.
Obviously, PCs are high-maintenance. Maybe my list was overkill - I tend to do that, but since I use a computer to make a living, I want it to perform as well and reliably as it can.
So, now I use a new iMac. While I'm hoping the list is shorter than the PC list, is there anything I should do to keep it performing optimally?

A: *

*Set up Time Machine the first time you start you Mac,

*Set up Software Update so that your system is always up to date.

*A shutdown once in a while should clean most of little garbage but you will have to perform it anyway with some software updates.


and


*

*Never log in with administrative privileges unless you have a serious reason to do so.


A: Aside from the advice given by mouviciel, you’ll need"|"to perform certain tasks. The good news is: it can happen automatically.
I suggest you get an utility either the free Onyx or the excellent (but Shareware) Cocktail. In a couple of minutes of experimenting with the options you can set that up to run automatically. 
Most of the cleaning tasks will be performed automatically. Of course, Time Machine and Software Updates are a good idea too. There are other utilities and you can probably find them with a simple Google query.

A: I will try to hit your points one by one. Truthfully, I've been running OS X for almost 6 years and from my experience, I have not seen any degradation of performance over time. But for what it's worth, I am quite obsessive over the quality of my system, from performance to security, so this is an area I've actually researched and continue to have a thumb in. Even TRIM support for SSDs is a mixed bag.


*

*Run CCleaner to clean up all the crap (temporary files, hidden
caches, etc.) that browsers leave behind
While having orphaned caches and preference files won't slow down your Mac, some don't like leaving cruft behind as it can take up valuable HD space. Apps like AppZapper and AppCleaner remove these files and may be something you wish to take a look at. Personally I use AppZapper.


*

*Run CCleaner to clean the registry
Mac OS X does not contain a registry. All preference files (which house your personal settings) are located in your users Library/Preferences folder. Letting them accumulate over time will not have a negative impact on your systems performance (see above).


*

*Run AdAware to clean up tracking cookies, etc.
Again, this will not adversely affect a system's performance, but you are certainly welcome to keep Safari free of garbage. Personally, I use Jar to achieve this. It is quite good, but unfortunately has not seen an update in quite a while. However, it is the cleanest and simplest app (there are others, but they require 3rd party plug-ins that may hurt your systems performance and stability) in this department.


*

*Run MalwareBytes malicious software removal tool
Unnecessary on OS X. It has a native system to handle ""malware"" and while there has been only one documented case that has made it's way into the wild (with relative success), this still remains very much a non-issue on OS X. You can read more about the malware Mac Defender, and what Apple did about it. Malware remains a point of contention because it cannot be installed without some level of user interaction (unlike Windows).


*

*Run Microsoft's malicious software removal tool to backstop
malwarebytes (hoping that at least one of them would find the
hard-to-catch stuff)
Again, not necessary. See above.


*

*Run MacAfee's virus scanner (This piece-of-crap software never did
anything but give me headaches. But it's popularity made me
uncomfortable just deleting it)
You'll be happy to discover that OS X does not contain viruses or requires any utility to protect it from such threats. Do not be bought into the FUD by those that would have you consume resources by installing anti-virus software for your Mac (yes, some exist). The most common argument is that it creates a protective barrier that may not be that useful on OS X, but will prevent the spread to machines running Windows. This is a non-starter because all Windows systems already contain anti-viruse software to protect them, ergo, they do not require an additional barrier.


*

*Run a disk defragmenter
Not required. Apple has actually archived their document covering this topic as defragmentation and file optimization on OS X is no longer an issue. You can find it here. In a nutshell, it is not something a user should ever worry about. Disregard those that would have you install or copy your data to and fro in a vain attempt to ""optimize"" your files. OS X simply does not suffer from the problems that plague Windows in this department.

A: No one's mentioned it but it's generally worthwhile making sure the space remaining on the primary OS drive is at least 10% of the drive space, this is mostly so the OS has room to work in. 
Apparently (I've never sat and verified it) leaving items on your desktop will be viewed by the OS as an item to be loaded into memory, so try keep your desktop free (which is always a good thing anyway) to keep it running nice and clean.
Remember to trash your cache files every 3 months or so.
After a while go to Disk Utility and repair permissions, it's a bit of a waving a headless chicken over your computer but they can occasionally cause some issues.
Go to the Spotlight settings and disable anything you're not interested in.
And finally just plain old kill the Dashboard, unless you have some specific love for it."|"to perform a regular cleanup of your hard drive using the built-in Disk Utility application.

244||"Q: What is the best method to apply a screen protector to a touchscreen? Installing a screen protector on a touchscreen is not always easy.  Bubbles and dust can make your screen look horrible.  What is the best method/procedure you have found to apply a screen protector?

A: First I make sure the screen is completely clean using a micro-fiber cloth, then I use a credit card with the cloth wrapped around to press the screen protector tightly as soon as it touches the screen.
The trick is to press, making a forward/backward movement, the protector against the screen as soon as it touches it, removing any bubbles in the process. So don't try to put the protector all at once.

A: I live in a dry climate, so preventing dust from"|"settling on the screen during application is one of the biggest concerns.  Another is in getting it aligned just right.  Here are some additional steps have used to get the absolute best results.  
Note: this involves using water and electronics together, so you must be very careful to use the absolute minimum amount of water and the absolute maximum amount of care.  It could void your warranty, ruin your device, and/or inflict serious personal injury.  Perform at your own risk!
Supplies


*

*Unopened screen protector

*A shower or bathroom you can steam up (dry/dusty climates)

*Microfiber cloth (I like the 3M Microfiber dusting cloth I picked up at the Grocery store)

*Canned air (just in case)

*Fine mist water sprayer (the InvisiShield screen protectors from Zagg come with a great sprayer filled with what I can only guess is distilled water)

*Small squeegee or something like it (credit card, etc.)


Procedure


*

*Steam up your bathroom or shower by running very hot water in your shower.  This will help ensure airborne dust is minimized

*Wash your hands throughly to remove oils from your fingerprints.

*After you shut off the water, bring your supplies in.

*Clean the screen using the microfiber cloth.  Inspect it carefully.  Use the canned air if necessary.  No dust should be visible at all.

*Peel off the backing of your screen protector (don't touch the back, handle only with the sites)

*Spray a very fine mist of water to the sticky side of the screen protector.  This will make it easier to align your screen protector precisely.

*Position the screen protector at one end, using the squeegee lightly as you go to push out bubbles.  The water will form a thin film that makes it much easier to push out bubbles to the edge.

*Once everything is in place and you have inspected for dust, use the squeegee and the microfiber cloth to push out bubbles and the thin water film to the edges.  Use the microfiber cloth to absorb water as it squirts out from under the protector, especially around buttons, case edgings, seams, and and other openings.

*Sometimes, a small bit of water is trapped under the screen protector, but in my experience it goes away after a couple of days in a dry climate."|touching the screen protector is important to me. To prevent dust from getting on the screen protector, I first clean the screen with a microfiber cloth.

A: Serviio is a free DLNA server, with a Mac version.
http://www.serviio.org/

A: There are several choices based on the fact that any UPnP server should also be DLNA compliant : 


*

*Free ones :

*XBMC

*MythTV

The bold ones are directly mentioned to be DLNA servers.

A: I've been using the PS3 media server.

A: I've had this same frustrating hunt for ages, tried and found all of them to have serious issues either with usability or actual functionality. Most sadly arent even worth trying. But then last week I found a poster who recommended Plex media server and its so good I'm trying to find the post and poster to thank him.
Plex server is totally free but you can pay for mobile clients. I have an iMac and MacBook Pro both running Mountain Lion, and the iMac now serves my xbox, wdtv live and archos 7 faultlessly. This may sound set up but save yourself the pain and effort and try Plex first.
Plex takes a while to run through a big, say 3tb collection but it genuinely has been the most painless and reliable of all I've tried and the searchable options are far more varied and sensible than those for others. Don't want to"|"name names but I've pretty much tried them all. The only thing I can't comment on is transcoding; I assume their clients manage this. From my perspective, I needed something to access my library, rather than rely on hardware specific transcoding. If you need this its a mixed bag regarding codec support, and I found the issues with other servers made the solution less viable. Connect360 was not bad for xbox, they also do a PS version, but for straight media serving, Plex no question.

A: There are some free as well as pay for options:

A: Specify Machine...

Probably the best bet on a PPC is to get a distro of Ubuntu and go from there....   then all we need is a decent client on our $200 Tablet with HDMI to flatscreen.
Otherwise you can get DAAP clients for cross platform music streaming from OSX boxes....

A: TVMOBiLi (free) works with Macs really well. I have Macbook Pro Retina and I use it every other day mostly with my PS3 and Samsung Smart TV. 
Due to my Smart TV not having a qwerty keyboard (and really rubbish remote). I tend to stream movies directly to the PS3 (which connects each time I switch it on).
I will rarely use it with my iPad but have the PlugPlayer app when I do.

A: Vuze is a free torrent client that includes DMS and transcoding. It's okay — to be fair, the DMS is still in beta, but works very well (though I can't pause video with it)

A: Playback is my favorite DLNA Server for MAC OS X, but I just found out that they closed business and are no longer supporting any of their software as of March 2014. I'm using Plex right now as the best of the two others that I've tried; Plex and XBMC (KODI). I just have problems with Plex not understanding my naming convention for TV show episodes. They get out of order and the program reads 4,14,114 as the number 4 for episode numbers. I previously spent a lot of time naming them how they make sense to me. I do enjoy the artwork that Plex brings up for certain titles.
Playback didn't try to re-order or rename anything. It just reflected exactly what the folder contents were in alphabetical order. It also had it's own security settings such as only allowing certain devices to connect to the server by ip address. When viewed through the PS3 it displayed album art or a snapshot from that episode.

A: MediaLink from NullRiver is a relatively inexpensive option ($20). It was extremely easy to setup -- it installs as a preference pane plug-in, there are four things to configure and a 'Start' button. Best of all, you can try it for free for 30 minutes; I purchased it after about 4.5 minutes. There's also an App-store version that is a straight-up application.
Caveats: I don't know if the pref-pane option will still work if/when I upgrade to El Capitan with its new security enhancements (no reason to think it won't, but you never know). Also, the last software was two years ago (2013), as of this writing. But it works and was easy to setup.

A: Elmedia Player

Elmedia Player is a Mac video player that offers advanced streaming options. It can handle any conceivable media format. Files can be streamed to Chromecast, AirPlay, Roku and DLNA devices. No additional codecs are required for it to work.

Since upgrading my iPhone 3GS to iOS 4.1, I've periodically seen 1 bar or ""Searching..."" at home and work where I used to have 4 or 5 bars.  And I've sent text messages with 4 bars, only to have it immediately drop to 1 and the text message error out.
I'm trying to learn if I'm alone with this issue (and should therefore bring my phone to my local Apple"|"Store—after trying a restore just so I can say I did when they inevitably suggest that), or if this is a common problem (and we should then file bugs at bugreport.apple.com).
Update (to answer Louis Gerbarg's question): I've installed every new update, so I believe I upgraded from 4.0.2 to 4.1.  I think I noticed Apple's bar display calibration changes after the 4.0.1 upgrade, though the difference was subtle.  I did not have dropped call problems and errors sending text messages until the 4.1 upgrade.
Update #2: I restored my iPhone to factory defaults (but still with 4.1 installed), and still had the problems.  So I took it to my local Apple Genius Bar and explained this, and they exchanged the phone for a new one.  The new iPhone 3GS had 4.0.2.  But I still don't have the problems after installing 4.1.  This must have been a hardware issue.

A: Did you move from 4.0 to 4.1, or from 4.0.1/2 to 4.1? Between 4.0 and 4.0.1 Apple changed the calibration of the bar display, such that at a given signal strength it shows a fewer bars. They did that in response to the iPhone 4 antenna publicity, but the changes were done for all devices that support 4.x.
So, if you went straight from 4.0 to 4.1 getting fewer bars is expected, though if you are dropping calls where you previously didn't that is a real issue, or if you updated from 4.0.2."|"store for repair) or if this is a widespread issue.

I'm just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this issue and if there's anything I can do to fix it, other than taking my phone to Apple for repair.

248||"Q: How can I automount afp volumes at startup? I bought a NAS to store my media files and I'd like to automount the volumes on startup. Currently I'm opening those volumes as a Login Item under System Preferences > Accounts.
This works, but it unfortunately also pops up each volume in a new Finder window on boot up. Checking the hide on the items only hides the processes, not the resulting Finder window from those processes. A solution that avoids those Finder popups would be great.
I'd like to avoid any 3rd party apps to accomplish this too.

A: I found this script from http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050215082247458, but I'll reproduce it below.


*

*Open up Script Editor and paste in: 



    set sfiles to ""afp://user:pass@host/volume""  
    tell application ""Finder""  
        mount volume sfiles   
    end tell



*

*Replace sfiles with the appropriate details of your AFP volume.

*Add"|"appropriate other lines for the other servers you have, both above and inside the tell

*Save this script somewhere safe and add it to the login item pane (instead of the Volumes you have there now)


A: TL;DR
Use AppleScript, but do not specify the user name or password.

Background
In my case, none of the suggestions that I found online worked perfectly.
I had several AFP volumes that I wanted to mount automatically. Following the advice given here and elsewhere, the obvious solution seemed to be an AppleScript file with something along these lines:
tell application ""Finder""
    try
        mount volume ""afp://user@server/a""
        mount volume ""afp://user@server/b""
        mount volume ""afp://user@server/c""
    end try
end tell

Now, this almost works. From the perspective of Finder, it looks as if all volumes are correctly mounted. However, if you use the terminal, you can see the problem. The following has happened:


*

*The volumes are mounted on directories /Volumes/a, /Volumes/b-1, and /Volumes/c-1.

*There are empty directories /Volumes/b and /Volumes/c.
Whether you care about it depends on your intended use, but I needed a solution in which the file system paths are more predictable.
After spending a lot of time playing with all variants of this, it seems that the crucial thing is the following: If you specify the user name and you have already mounted some volumes from the same AFP server, things go wrong.
Hence the following solution.

Solution


*

*Make sure that everything works correctly when you use Finder: you can mount volumes by clicking on the share, and you do not need to enter any passwords. If Finder asks for a user name and password, tell it to remember the password.

*Create an AppleScript application as follows. Open AppleScript Editor. Write a piece of code like this:
tell application ""Finder""
    try
        mount volume ""afp://server/a""
        mount volume ""afp://server/b""
        mount volume ""afp://server/c""
    end try
end tell

Here ""server"" is the host name of the server (if Finder displays the server name ""x"", you can try to use the host name ""x.local""). Replace ""a"", ""b"", and ""c"" with the names of the volumes that you want to mount. Make sure you do not try to specify any user names or passwords. Compile and save it, using the file format ""Application"" (you will get the file name extension "".app"" automatically).

*Test it by running the application that you just created. Most likely it asks for the user name and password; enter them and again tell it to remember the password.

*Unmount (using Finder), and try it again. It should just work, without asking anything. The paths should be correct (no -1 suffixes).

*Add the application to your login items (System Preferences; Users & Groups)."|"to the end of the BEGINNING.



*

*Save the file as an .scpt file.

*Open Automator and create a new action.

*Drag the .scpt file into the action.

*Save the action and name it something meaningful.

*Add it to your login items.

A: I made a simple app that displays cpu and memory usage on menubar, free and open sourced. Feedback is welcome.
https://github.com/ningt/iStats


A: I created a free app that shows percentage on the menu bar:

MenuMeters is freeware, but well worth the donation.
The original author has stopped maintaining MenuMeters, but someone new has taken over for El Capitan.  

A: I prefer SystemPal. iStat itself consumes too much CPU and RAM. SystemPal is quick, tiny, configurable, neat, and powerful. It's available on Mac App Store.

A: Not sure how long this has been a feature, but it's possible to replace the Activity Monitor dock icon with a graph showing CPU usage, CPU history, network usage, or disk activity.

For example, showing CPU history turns the icon into this little graph:


A: iStat Menus has the functionality you are asking for. It is available starting at USD$14.39 for a single license or $17.99 for a family pack (up to five different Macs). It's also included with a membership to SetApp.

A: Check out iGlance it's open source.



A: A free open source solution is CpuInfo on GitHub (shows cpu only)

A: I really liked eul. Slick design and great configuration ability. Widgets are also available.


brew install --cask eul

A: One that hasn't been mentioned yet is Stats, which describes itself as a

Simple macOS system monitor in your menu bar

It's an excellent open source project (https://github.com/exelban/stats) that can be installed via:
brew install stats


On big sur, after downloading, open launchpad, search for 'stats', and open it. It will start showing up in the menu bar.

A: Or you can try some geeklets from the internet (or make one yourself) on Geektool. I find it more customizable than menu bar apps, and prettier when I get to use the fonts and sizes I like.

254||"Q: Note taking for school I'm considering getting a Macbook or a Macbook Pro (I use Windows on my desktop computer), and I'm thinking about how note taking could be done.
Most I'm thinking would use Microsoft Word/Pages, but OneNote seems to be loved a lot of people, especially for education purposes, and it's mandatory for use for people in Years 9 and 10 in my school thanks to the NSW Digital Education Revolution.
But OneNote isn't in Office 2008, nor is it in Office 2011. So what I'm asking is that if I take the plunge, will there be any alternatives, apart from the obvious of virtualisation, Wine or CrossOver? I'm fine with using Wine/CrossOver, it's just that I would be expecting a native experience to be better.
According to a friend of mine, Word has a notebook feature, although"|"I can't find anything about it through Google.

A: Check out Evernote. There are Windows, Mac, iPhone, and web versions, and all your notes are synchronized to all your devices. You can even take pictures, include them in notes, and then search any text that was in the pictures.

A: Yes, Word 2008/Mac has a notebook view, which I think would work fine for you. The #1 thing I like about it is that it can record audio simultaneously with your note-taking, so you can go back and listen to just that snippet of whatever the professor said, based on the notes you took that moment.
Word 2011/Mac is coming out next month, btw, and I don't know for sure what will/won't be included/changed/updated.
If you need to synchronize documents among multiple machines, I highly recommend Dropbox.

A: It's not OneNote, but all my Mac friends seem to use OmniOutliner.  If native experience is important to you, OmniOutliner is hard to beat.
Also, depending on what Mac you buy and when, Apple sometimes includes one or more of Omni's programs for free.

A: Without turning this into a “let’s list all the applications we can”, I’d venture and recommend you a couple of note taking applications with a radically different approach:
Voodoo Pad (and it’s Lite counterpart) have a very interesting concept of how your notes end up being some sort of “wiki” where certain words link to other ‘pages’ of your notes. It’s a very popular Mac application and even the Lite (free) version can be all you want. I suggest you take a look at its list of features.
A different approach is given by an application like Notebook, which also offers an interesting concept that mimics a “real” notebook but with the advantages of a Computer interface. 
Finally there are two applications I like to keep around at all times for fast note taking that are “plain text” but insanely fast to launch/use:
One is Hog Bay Software’s TaskPaper and the other is Notational Velocity. Extremely simple but more efficient than a bunch of “TextEdit” files spread across the drive. 
As already suggested, using Dropbox is always a good idea.
It has already been suggested but Evernote is a nice application (which I really never use), but has a lot of fans because of its features.

A: I use Pear Note on a daily basses to record all my lectures, it makes it easy to check though your notes and see what the tutor sad for each part."|Q: Note taking for school I'm considering getting a Macbook or a Macbook Pro (I use Windows on my desktop computer), and I'm thinking about how note taking could be done.

*Failing that, disable bluetooth and/or wifi if they are unnecessary

*Disable as much Spotlight search as you can afford to by going to Settings->General->Home Button->Spotlight Search.

A: You should wait until Apple releases iOS 4.1 that should improve overall performances on old iDevices, like iPod Touch 2G and iPhone 3G.

A: You may want to check any applications running in the ""multi-task"" mode.  I had a issue with my iPhone 4 dieing quickly when I had certain apps still trying to queue the network.  Good luck!

A: I have an iPhone 4 and went through this issue with Apple Genius Bar guys and Level 2 support over the phone. The conclusion was the when a contact is modified on the iPhone/iPod in an Exchange account (like Gmail) the device gets into and endless loop trying to update the remote database. It stops only when finally the device is connected to a data plan or wifi connection to the server to be updated.
Strangely enough the issue is only with contacts, not with calendar or mails.

A: In Finder ""columns"" view, double click the block below the scroll bar arrows to auto fit column width.
via @Mactip

A: ⌘ + ` (backtick accent) switches between multiple windows of the same app.

A: To quickly lock your computer with a screen-saver style password, regardless of whether a password or time delay is set in the Security preference pane, enable the keychain status menu item and use its Lock Screen command. To enable it, open the Keychain Access utility, choose Preferences… from the Keychain Access menu, and enable ""Show Status in Menu Bar"" from the General pane.


A: Want to move back and forth through your navigation history? Most apps, including Safari and Finder, let you use the following shortcuts:
⌘+[ to move back.
⌘+] to move forward.

A: LaTex from Grapher:


A: In any Open/Save dialog window, hitting ⌘+D opens the desktop folder.

A: ⇧+⌥+← or ⇧+⌥+→ can be used to select the previous or next word.

A: I love the DigitalColor Meter application (in /Applications/Utilities) for finding the color of something on screen (especially useful for web development). cmd + shift + h to lock/hold the color you're on, ⌘+⇧+c to copy the value as RGB Hex value.

A: By pressing ⌥ + ⇧ + + you can create the  - Symbol on a german keyboard.
The tilde-key btw is created by pressing ⌥+N for all those who searched `~´
For English (American) keyboards, the shortcut is: Option ⌥ + Shift ⇧ + K

A: The 'Open Terminal Here' applescript that can be added to the finder toolbar(?), is a great way of getting a shell prompt to the folder your are viewing. 
The 'original' is at the pages of its author Marc Liyanage:
http://www.entropy.ch/software/applescript/
He kindly links to a number of other versions so you can take your pick.
The other side of the coin (though not worth it's own answer) is the command
open .
to open a finder window for the current shell folder.

A: You can access the File, Edit and other application menus with the 'Change the way Tab moves focus' setting in Keyboard -> Shortcuts Preferences. I changed it from the default to Ctrl+` as the default merely adjusted brightness.


A: If you connect two Mac's directly using a standard ethernet cable, you can quickly transfer files between them.  It automatically configures the connection, and is much faster than doing large transfers over wireless.

A: When resizing columns in Finder, hold down ⌥ whilst dragging, and you'll resize all columns and reset the default width.

A: In order to navigate with the keyboard in the menu bar, press ctrl+F2. The Apple icon in the menu bar will light up, and you can navigate through the menus using arrows and the ↩ key.
Once you are in the menu bar you can also navigate using initial letters, e.g. b to go to Bookmarks

A: Ever wanted to stop the iTunes visualizer at that really cool moment and take a picture? In iTunes 10 (and previous versions really) you can control what your visualizer is doing. You need to have a song playing to notice changes. 
Simply press the ? key to see a help menu of the controls. On most visualizers press f to see the current FPS. (all except the default)
To freeze the default iTunes visualizer press F to freeze the mode, then press L to freeze the camera. Now that your visualizer is completely stopped, press M to change the mode. Turn the fog on and off with N (only works with certain themes). Change the color palette with P before freezing the mode or locking the camera or it has no effect. ⌘ + F  for full screen, then ⌘+⇧+3 for full screen grab.
Viola, instant custom desktop pattern! 

A: Holding ⌘ lets you drag icons in your menu bar to reorder them. Dragging them out of the menu bar removes them.
All of the built-in icons support this behavior, but most third-party apps don't.

A: 3rd party apps can add unwanted items to your right click menus!  To add or remove items from the right click contextual menus:
Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts. Select the ""Services"" panel and uncheck the services which you don't need. 

A: When switching focus between applications, you can hold down ⌥ and click on another application. When you change focus from one application to another, the first application hides. So, let's say you are switching from an open Finder window to an open TextEdit window while holding the ⌥ key. Finder will hide once you click on the TextEdit window. I discovered this by accident and it's pretty cool

A: In iTunes, it’s possible to make ⌘ + F focus the search input instead of toggling the full screen mode.
Simply enter this command in Terminal.app:
defaults write com.apple.iTunes NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add ""Target Search Field"" ""@F""

Then, restart iTunes.
Disclaimer: This is just one of the many goodies in my .osx file.

A: To paste plain text without any formatting use ⇧+⌥+⌘+V.
That's very useful when working in app like Keynote and copying some text from webpage. 
Note: It doesn't work if any other function assigned to this shortcut. To fix that just change the default shortcut in the app to something else. 

A: When you drag and drop any file (or folder) from Finder onto a Terminal window, it gets converted into the full (absolute) path to that file.
I find this a small but occasionally useful trick when dealing with files in both Finder and Terminal.

A: Hold ctrl and move the scroll wheel (or use two fingers on trackpad). It will zoom in the entire screen.
This setting can be enabled or changed in the System Preferences, under Acessibility, Zoom.

A: Hibernate your MacBook Pro with
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25
and then put it to sleep which will save the state of your system and then power off. Very handy when flying.
If instead you want very fast sleeps, without writing memory to disk, use
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
To restore the default behaviour, use
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3

A: Quickly find your search results in Safari 


*

*Perform a Google search in the toolbar 

*Click a result 

*Press ⌘+G
via @Mactip

A: Remember the double-sided arrows on both the top and bottom of the scroll column in OS 9? Go to the terminal and type: 
defaults write ""Apple Global Domain"" AppleScrollBarVariant DoubleBoth

When you login/restart, this will work across all applications. Very handy to have.

A: If you want to quickly resize your Dock you can click and drag the bar that separates the apps from minified windows, the Trash etc. If your Dock is on the bottom then drag up to increase the size of the dock and down to make them smaller. Drag left/right if your Dock is on the side of the screen.

A: If you use random Backgrounds,
there is a quick way to make them change when you want.
type in the terminal 
killall Dock

This will make your random Desktopbackground change.

A: An often-neglected feature of OS X is the ability to drag files and proxy icons into other applications or windows.
Try this in Adobe apps. Why use the File > Place… command? Just drag a file directly from the Finder directly into the document you’re working on.
Drag files onto Dock icons to open that JPG in Photoshop rather than iPhoto. Drag an image from your browser into Photoshop’s Dock icon.

A: When closing an unsaved document ⌘+D will invoke Don't Save for you.
Use with care though.

A: You can play tetris in Terminal:
When you are in Terminal type emacs and hit enter. After that press escape button and X button at the same time. Now just type tetris and hit enter.
Same goes for pong, 5x5, snake, tetris, dunnet and blackbox, just type its name instead of tetris

A: Here's one I learned a long time ago, still works today.
Keyboard shortcut for proper single and double quotes:
Single Quotes


*

*For Left ( ‘ ) press: Alt + ] 

*For Right ( ’ ) press: Alt + Shift + ]
Double Quotes


*

*For Left ( “ ) press: Alt + [

*For Right ( ” ) Alt + Shift + [

A: If you need to type an accented letter like ""é"" or ""ñ"" just press and hold the corresponding letter on your keyboard and a little popup will appear with numbered letters with accents. You can also click the letter of your choice.


A: Show the full directory path in the Finder window. 
In the Terminal, run this:
defaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool YES

Then, run this.
killall Finder

There are all sorts of hidden defaults that can be mucked around with but this is my absolute favorite because now no matter which window I am looking at, I know exactly where I am.
You should also check out TinkerTool for other hidden settings.

A: Drag and drop files and folders to ""Open"" dialogs/sheets: very useful to open package contents with other software.
Just locate the file with the Finder

and drag and drop it to the Open dialog

Bonus: you can do the same thing with 'Upload file' web forms. (Only with WebKit-based browser)
 ➔ 

A: Holding ⌥ (or ⌥fn on MacBooks, and depending on your System Prefs*) while pressing one of the function-row keys will bring up the System Preference panel for that key. Here's a list:


*

*⌥+Brightness: Displays

*⌥+Exposé/Dashboard: Exposé and Spaces

*⌥+Mute/Volume: Sound

*⌥+Keyboard Brightness: Keyboard (for Macs with backlit keyboards)


*If you have checked the option to use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys, done in System Preferences>Keyboard, then you will need to add the fn to the afore mentioned sequences.

A: You can disable 3D Dock effect ( if you don't like ) when dock is at bottom.
Use tinker tool (it's free).
Now, switch to Dock tab, do as instructed in image.


A: You can adjust the scale of all windows (sizes of buttons and menus and toolbars) to fit more on a smaller screen. It was really helpful on my TV setup, because I couldn't see the bottom items in the System Preferences.
defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleDisplayScaleFactor .75

to reset simply
defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleDisplayScaleFactor 1

Or you can change it per Application
defaults write com.apple.iTunes AppleDisplayScaleFactor .7


A: Target Disk Mode lets you mount a Firewire-enabled Mac as an external disk, without even booting into the OS.  Useful for quick transfers, large transfers (it's quite fast), recovery, etc.
To start it, hold T during startup.

A:  sudo purge

I use this all the time for freeing unused memory on my Mac.

A: El Capitan has a new split full screen feature, where you can have two apps open at once. I use it all the time, but the one thing I find inconvenient about is that it will very strongly blur the un-focused window when resizing a pane:

You can hold down ⌥ while resizing to see both screens respond to your resize changes -- neither will be blurred.

A: When I migrated from Windows to Mac OS X, what I really missed is the ability to move files with cut (Ctrl + X) and paste (Ctrl + V) (as opposed to copy and paste).
It turns out Finder has this capability as well, but it's more like 'mark and move': Cmd + C and then Alt + Cmd + V.

A: Since El Capitan (OS X 10.10), the green button in the top left of a window does not resize the window as it used to, but instead turns it into full-screen mode.
To get the old behavior back, hold down the ⌥ key, which will turn the green button's symbol from the resizer to a + as it used to be.

A: macOS has a built-in option to mass rename files (including changing the extension), which I found here while looking for a shell script snippet to do the trick. Just select the files, right click and choose ""Rename n items ..."". The Replace Text dialog is rather self-explanatory.

A: Secrets is a database with a huge amount of hidden settings for both the system and some common applications.
This domain is now offline and the developer appears to have parked the work (based on MacUpdates activity). It was originally launched for OS 10.6 as a preferences pane although the data was delivered from a Google server which is now down. However :) - you can see some of the previous secrets listed as a web archive (may take a minute to load):

Sept 2016

A: On i.a. en-US keyboards ⌘+` will cycle through multiple open windows in your current application.
On some other keyboard layouts the hot key may be e.g. ⌘+<.
You can verify—and modify—your ""Move focus to next window in application"" shortcut under System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Keyboard & Text Input.

A: alt + ⌘ + left click in the dock hides all windows except application currently in focus. Great if you find window clutter distracting.

A: When ⌥+clicking on an open app in the Dock the application hides.

A: You can force Exposé to only show windows that are on the current Space (instead of all windows open on any Space). Type the following into Terminal:
defaults write com.apple.dock wvous-show-windows-in-other-spaces"|"-bool FALSE

then, to restart Dock:
killall Dock


A: When you're in the ⌘+Tab task switcher selecting the Finder and pressing ⇧+Q will restart the Finder.

A: Hide an Application While Cmd-Tabbing
While using ⌘+Tab, you can press H to hide/show the app that is currently selected.

A: You can prevent app from appearing in Dock by editing .app/Contents/Info.plist. Just add 
<key>LSUIElement</key>
<true/>


A: Probably the most used shortcut I created on my machine is one to hide and show hidden files.
I've set this up via an AppleScript on my machine with a keyboard shortcut of ^ + ⌘ + ⇧ + . which toggles the visibility of hidden files within Finder whenever I want.  This way I don't have to manually run a terminal command to show hidden files, and I can quickly turn it off to avoid accidentally modifying system files. I use FastScripts to allow me to set the keyboard shortcut for my AppleScript, and placed the AppleScript in my ~/Library/Scripts Folder.
Here is the AppleScript in case you wish to give it a try:
tell application ""System Events""

    set hiddenFilesDisplayStatus to do shell script ""defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles""
    set hiddenFilesNewDisplayStatus to ""NO""

    if hiddenFilesDisplayStatus is ""NO"" then
        set hiddenFilesNewDisplayStatus to ""YES""
    end if

    do shell script ""defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles "" & hiddenFilesNewDisplayStatus
    do shell script ""killall Finder""

end tell


A: The Guest account is great for troubleshooting.
If I have a software issue, logging in as Guest lets me open an app with 'clean' preferences settings.  
It's helped me with network issues as well.  
To enable Guest logins, go to System Preferences, Users & Groups, Guest User, and check Allow guests to log in to this computer.  

A: I really find the inbuilt dictionary useful on Cocoa apps like Safari and Mail etc.
With your cursor over a word, press ctrl+⌘+D to get a definition.
You can also drag a word straight onto the Safari icon in the Dock to perform a Google search for the word.

A: Holding down ⇧ while using the mouse scroll wheel will scroll the window horizontally.

A: Most animations in macOS can be played in slow motion, when you hold 
⇧(Shift). Works for example to slowly minimize windows if you click the minimize button while holding the 
⇧(Shift) key.
Other examples are:

*

*toggle exposé

In macOS, while in the finder, open any window & click the minimizie button (yellow) at the top of the window while holding shift.
This will minimize the window in slow motion using the new ""genie effect"" minimize function of macOS.
The CEO of Apple has shown this egg publicly several times. However, this egg is undocumented & has no system menu equivalent to use this feature. Anyone who has NOT followed the development of macOS & watched the demos at the MacWorld trade shows would not realize this somewhat useless feature exists in macOS.


A: In any Finder window or Open/Save dialog, you can hit ⌘⇧G (just '/' also works in Open/Save) to get a location bar from which you can directly type in the directory to go to. It even supports ~ for home and tab completion.
The Open/Save dialog has several other useful shortcuts:


*

*⌘ R -
Reveals the selected item in a new
Finder window.

*⌘ I - Info window shows for the selected item.

*⌘ ⇧ > - Shows/Hides hidden files in the dialog

*⌘ F - cursor jumps to the Find text field

*/ or ~ - Opens a Go To Folder dialogue. 

*⌘ D or ⌘ ⇧ D - selects the ~/Desktop folder as a destination

*⌘ ⌥ L - selects ~/Downloads folder as a destination

*⌘ ⇧ O - selects ~/Documents folder as a destination

*⌘ ⌥ S - Shows/Hides sidebar

*⌘ . or esc - Cancels and closes the dialog window


A: Exposé for spaces and 'Show desktop' attached to corners of the screen. I've attached 'Show desktop' to my lower right corner, and Exposé for spaces in the top left. Now, i can go bottom right to the desktop, grab a file, move over to the top left to switch to a space, and drop it there in a Finder window or Application.

A: Do a ""killall dock"" in Terminal while a window is being minimized with the Genie effect (helps to hold down Shift to slow it down) and the window will be 'stuck' in the Genie effect yet still be operational! For example, you can still scroll.

A: If you are a recent convert to osx and miss the mouse/cursor acceleration of a windows mouse?
OSX mouse doesnt feel quite as good as the windows mouse?
Give SteerMouse a try!

A: There is a fast way to create a hidden folder on Mac OS.
Hidden folders a created by typing ""."" on the beginning (e.g. "".hiddenfolder"")
The Finder won't let you do this though.
So we gonna use the terminal.
to create a new folder:
mkdir .hiddenfolder

first of course you have to navigate to the location, you want the folder to be.
For example the Desktop:
cd /Users/USERNAME/Desktop/

or drag a folder into the Terminal to get it's address
To know where you are right now, type:
pwd

Another way is, to rename a folder. To do so type:
mv ActualFolderName .hiddenfolder

To open a hidden folder, make hidden files visible like described earlier,
or use terminal (navigate there first, or type open absolute path)
open .hiddenfolder

or if you are in the hidden folder already, just type
open .

to show hidden folders/files in terminal type
ls -a


A: If you drag files while holding the command key, the contents move but don't copy. Great for cutting the copy - then delete original process.

A: Secrets by Blacktree is a preference pane which enables many hidden OS X and specific application preferences (e.g. change Dock to 2D, change iTunes stoplights back to horizontal). Saves you a couple of trips to the Terminal.

A: Not sure if it's posted already but you can drag folders and files from the finder into an application's open / save dialogue. It sets the save or open path to that of the folder or file you're dragging. Excellent when you prefer to use the finder to navigate but don't want to repeat the process in your app or vice versa. Also, on many cases, whilst in the open / save dialogue, you can hit command R to reveal the files in the finder.

A: You can ⌘-click and drag many OS provided icons from your menu bar to rearrange or remove them if it's getting too crowded.  Doesn't work with all 3rd party ones, but many built-in ones (like volume, battery, sync, bluetooth, etc) can be removed this way.   Many of them can be removed from the control panel, but this is the only way some of them can be removed once activated (that I'm aware of). 

A: I am new to Mac so this might be common knowledge but in snow leopard if you hold 3 and 2 during boot you will boot into 32 bit mode and the same goes foe 64 bit when holding the 6 and 4 keys during boot. Macfuse for example did not like running in 64 bit mode

A: Hold ctrl and scroll with the mouse/trackpad in order to zoom the view at any time. Extremely handy in order to discern pixel differences of a UI.

A: ⌘ + ⇥ = switch between applications.
Press ⌥ before releasing ⌘ and it will un-minimize minimized windows from that application.

A: Hold Option & click Speaker/Volume icon in top menu bar to quickly select audio output and input devices (bluetooth, airplay etc.)

A: Create a Keyboard Shortcut to open Terminal (or any application) no matter where you are or what application is currently active.
Use Automator to create a Service. Within Actions choose Launch Application.
In my case I made sure that the service receives no input in any application.
Then from the dropdown select other then double-click Utilities then select Terminal.app and click choose.
Save the service and make sure it has a .workflow extension.
Next open up System Preferences and click on the keyboard. Click the Shortcuts tab and select the Services option on the left.
You should see your new service in the General section named whatever you chose to name it. 
Then you can click the none button that indicates it has no shortcut yet and assign it whatever shortcut keys you want.
There are other ways but this works no matter what application is active and it never fails.

A: Extremely quick way to open a new Finder window:


*

*Click on the desktop (even a sliver will do)

*Hit ⌘N
The desktop is part of Finder, so in a lot of ways it acts as a Finder window itself.  For me it's faster to select the Finder app by just clicking on the desktop than to use Spotlight or to switch apps to Finder.

A: During a spotlight search, hit ⌘B to Google that term in Safari.  Gives very quick access to a google search.
I assume the search setting in Safari determines which search engine is used.

A: In file open and file save dialogs: Hit ⌘+⇧+. to show all hidden files and folders.
Note that this appears to be true for any keyboard, no matter what ⇧+. on its own produces on that keyboard.
The commercial extension TotalFinder makes this feature available to normal Finder windows as well.

A: *

*When typing text in any document or text field ⌥ option+← backspace will delete the entire word, the same with ⌥ option+del which will delete the whole next word.

*On MacBooks and aluminum keyboards, typing fn+← backspace leads to typing the del key, deleting the character in front of the cursor, not before it.

*Using an accented language? Press ⌃ ctrl+← backspace after an accented letter to delete just the accent, not the letter.

A: I still think ⌘ + ⌥ + ⇧ + v (paste without style) is very handy.
That is, when something is on the clipboard and has unwanted styles along for the ride, this keyboard shortcuts lets you paste just the plain text without any formatting.

A: In iTunes pressing ⌘ + L brings you to the song playing right now.
Helpful if you lost yourself in your collection or are in iTunes Store and want to change something real quick.
Very useful in combination with ⌘ + I to show the details of the currently playing song.

A: Have a menu command/keyboard shortcut that you know exists, but you can't find it (or just don't want to touch your mouse)?
Press ⌘-⇧-/ to get to the help menu.  It'll pop up the help menu that you can type into.  Type the word you want to search the menus for, then ↓ to the menu item you want.  OSX will helpfully show you where that item exists in the menu with a big blue arrow and you'll also see any associated shortcuts.


A: Also TinkerTool shows some hidden features

A: Safari also supports a subset of Emacs keybindings

A: If you want to Open/Close FrontRow just use ⌘ + esc

A: One of the most amazing things I know to do in the terminal is ""doctor terminal"" I just love it! :D
I know it's a silly program that's easy to make but, no other operating system has it.
This is accessed through emacs in the Terminal:


*

*Type emacs

*Press Ctrl+X

*Type doctor

*Press Return
After each question, you can recieve a response by pressing Return twice in a row.

A: ⌘ + ctrl + ""two finger swipe"" = change the opacity of the window under the cursor

A: In an any Open/Save dialog, you can use Quicksilver to quickly find the desired file or folder and just drag it anywhere into the file dialog, sendig the file chooser directly to that location. [Enter] will do the rest.
(While not included in OSX, I assume, that the majority of users interested in this thread do run Quicksilver.app)

A: Custom Alert Sounds - An old trick from OS9 days (tested to 10.8) is to create your own alert sounds. Not entirely productive but if you are into hacking your Mac / OS to make it your own, this is one on the list - it's fun to have Peter Griffin tell you it's time for lunch.  


*

*Sample your sound file as usual (download or record/input to the Mac using something like Sound Studio or QT Pro 7). 

*edit down to 10 seconds or less adding a clean entry and exit

*export as an AIFF file

*place here: /System/Library/Sounds/*

*select the alert sound via the System Preferences / Sound / Sound Effects panel


Note: the Library folder may be invisible by default. If so open terminal and add the following to make it permanently visible: 
chflags nohidden ~/Library/

Note2: this route path will facilitate a sound file available to all users on your Mac. You can keep it to yourself by placing the AIFF here: 
/Users/username/Library/Sounds/


A: Text Edit - restore zoom feature in 10.7 / 10.8+
This is a helpful tip to remedy Apple's less than useful update to the ubiquitous Text Edit application from OS 10.7 following which they removed the incremental 'Zoom' control shown below.

I am aware of the keyboard shortcuts CMD + and CMD - that work post 10.7, however, the zoom increments with this method are pre-fixed and too large for me - I am most comfortable with 125% and to be honest, I am bugged that a useful function has been removed. So the action:


*

*Delete the default version of Text Edit in the system / apps folder (you can drag this app to the trash or use a program like AppZapper). If you go the manual method, delete the preferences file as well.

*beg, steal or borrow a copy of OS 10.6. Most regular Mac users will have one archived (I have Mac OS's back to 6.5, although I am sad).

*drag a copy of Text Edit 1.7.1 (or earlier - 1.6 should work from OS 10.5) to your current applications folder.





*

*Select any text edit document, get info (CMD + I) and set Text Edit 1.7.1 as the default application to open this type of file. 


Note: you may get an error message from Text Edit stating that it cannot save the file due to a permissions error. Don't worry, the file is being saved OK under OS 10.7+ and the false flag is due to an Apple change in the way newer versions of Text Edit auto-save. To suspend this reporting, you can soft hack Text Edit 1.7.1's behavior in terminal with the following command.
defaults write -app textedit ApplePersistence -bool false
defaults write -app textedit AutosavingDelay -int 0
Hope you find this tip helpful.

A: You can drag-drop Finder objects (or any document window's proxy icons) while doing any of the following:


*

*App-Switching (⌘+Tab or ⌘+⇧+Tab), 

*Spaces (⌃+→ or ⌃+←), 

*Show Desktop (⌘+F3), or 

*Mission Control (⌃+↑).


Combined with dropping into open/save dialogues, this means you'll never have to navigate to a file in one app and then navigate to the same file again in the open/save dialog. You'll also never have move windows around in order to drop a file into Safari.
Eg. I have an image open in Preview, and want to send it as an attachment in gmail.


*

*Gmail pops open the ""select attachment"" file dialogue:


*Start dragging the proxy Icon from Preview - don't let go of it


*While continuing to drag the file, switch apps with ⌘+Tab.


*

*Keep holding ⌘, but release/hit Tab or ⇧+Tab repeatedly to get to Safari.

*Let go of ⌘ once Safari is selected, to bring it to the front.



*Drop the file onto the file dialogue, and it'll become selected.

File is selected and ready to send. Return to finish selecting the file.

If you save screenshots to the desktop, then a similar trick is useful with the ""Show Desktop"" keyboard shortcut (⌘+F3).

A: Quickly insert weird characters into text by setting Text-Replacement Keyboard Shortcuts for any characters you find in the ""Emoji & Symbols"" panel.
I personally use LaTeX-style shortcuts, so typing \arrowright gets replaced with →. Type a Space after the \arrowright to do the replacement.
Set your shortcuts in SysPrefs > Keyboard > Text

You can copy/paste characters from anywhere into the Replace With... column. I prefer to double-click characters from the Emoji & Symbols pane, so I know they're in the standard font packages. The Emoji & Symbols pane can be enabled by selecting
SysPrefs > Keyboard > Keyboard (tab) > Show Keyboard and Emoji Viewers in menu bar
and then choosing Emoji & Symbols in the resulting menu item:


A: Ever downloaded an app that Mac OS won't let you open because it's ""from an unidentified developer""?
Instead of completely disabling this security feature (via SysPrefs>Security), try the following:


*

*Right-click the .app file

*hold Shift while clicking Open.  

*The resulting warning now has an [Open] button, click it.

*The warning is circumvented for this app only, but still enabled system-wide. It will never warn you again for that particular app.


A: In TextEdit, you can go to a specific line number by hitting ⌘L. Useful if a script errors at a specific line number.


A: If you have an iPhone (or iPad) with iOS 12, and a Mac with macOS Mojave, you can use the iPhone as a scanner or photo camera to directly scan documents or take photos. The scanner will even rotate and resize the document so that it appears as a rectangle. This function is integrated in a few Apple apps like Finder, Mail, Messages and the iWork apps.

For more information, see the Apple Support article Use Continuity Camera on your Mac.

A: On newer versions of macOS , you can access an interactive tool for taking screenshots via ⌘+Shift+5.
Modes
You can use three different modes.
Capture/Record Entire Screen
This mode is basic and lets you capture the entire screen. It replicates the functionality of ⌘+Shift+3.
Capture/Record Selected Portion
This mode allows you to crop out parts of the screen beforehand. You can move or resize the selected portion. The width and height of the portion will appear while resizing. This mode replicates the functionality of ⌘+Shift+4.
Capture Selected Window
This screenshot-exclusive mode allows you to take a screenshot of a window. Windows include context menus and other UI items as well. This mode replicates the functionality of ⌘+Shift+4 after pressing Space and selecting a window.
Preview/Markup
After capturing your screenshot or recording, you can view a preview of it. Right-clicking this preview allows you to set its save location, open it, delete it, or use Markup.

Markup editor allows you to draw freehand circles, add text, crop, or rotate screenshots.

The Markup editor also allows you to trim recordings.


A: By long-pressing on the bookmarks tab on the sidebar, you can open a menu containing the structure of the bookmarks folder. You can move your mouse to jump to a folder from this menu.


A: This is a pretty common one, but to show all hidden files you can type the command
defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles 1

and then
killall Finder

in Terminal.
To reverse, repeat using a 0 instead of 1.

A: Image Wells
All good mac programs contain image wells for opening files, such as the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System Preferences:  
1[]1
or in Filemerge:

This nifty litte things allow you to drag-and-drop files into them (and in some cases, out of) to load them into the program. Here, I am changing the wallpaper by dragging the file out of Finder and into the image well:


A: In the terminal, you can pipe the output of any command to pbcopy to copy it to the system clipboard. You can also paste from the system clipboard using pbpaste, and pipe that to another command or write the value directly to a file:
Copy a string: echo ""ohai im in ur clipboardz"" | pbcopy
Copy the HTML of StackOverflow.com: curl ""http://stackoverflow.com/"" | pbcopy
Open a new buffer in VIM, initialized to the content of the clipboard: pbpaste | vim -
Save the contents of the clipboard directly to a file: pbpaste > newfile.txt

A: Disable Caps-Lock
The ability to disable the Caps Lock key is wonderful (open System Preferences, go to Keyboard, then click the button titled Special Keys or Modifier Keys). It is not really hidden, but I never need the key, but especially on my MacBook I sometimes hit it by fault.
Some people also use this panel to replace Caps Lock with Control. Especially useful when you're using Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E shortcuts a lot.

A: You can add spacers to your Dock. Some apps make them for you or you can use the Terminal:
defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{tile-data={}; tile-type=""spacer-tile"";}'

Afterwards, use the following command to restart your dock:
killall Dock

You will see a spacer appear. Like normal apps, they can be removed and repositioned by dragging.
You can add spacers multiple times by repeating the first command. For example, this Dock has 2 spacers:


A: I always find the ⌘+⇧+4, space (you must press space at the end otherwise it doesn't work) command is really useful, and one that a lot of people don't know you can do. Upon pressing space, you get a large camera icon for your cursor, and it allows you to take a screenshot just of the highlighted window. The nice thing is that OS X preserves the window drop shadow, with full alpha transparency. So when you paste the images into other documents, they look fab.

More screenshot magic from 3rdparty.
Screenshot Secrets via: http://digitalmedia.oreilly.com/2006/01/01/mac-os-x-screenshot-secrets.html:


*

*⌘+⇧+3  Capture entire screen and save as a file

*⌘+ctrl+⇧+3  Capture entire screen and copy to the clipboard

*⌘+⇧+4  Capture dragged area and save as a file

*⌘+ctrl+⇧+4  Capture dragged area and copy to the clipboard

*⌘+⇧+4 then space    Capture a window, menu, desktop icon, or the menu bar and save as a file

*⌘+ctrl+⇧+4 then space    Capture a window, menu, desktop icon, or the menu bar and copy to the clipboard

*Another useful trick is to hold space while drawing a capture area to reposition it.

*Another trick is to hold option while drawing a capture area, to resize the area in all directions, instead of just the one corner you're dragging.

*For fine-tuning on a certain axis, you can hold shift and the axis you next move in is the one you'll control.

*Hit esc while capturing an area or window to exit capture mode.
Note: I added this because I find it to be useful. I don't mean any offense to anyone's answer in doing so.

A: You can increase or decrease your volume, brightness, or keyboard backlighting brightness by quarter increments by using the following combination:
⌥ + ⇧ + Volume Up/Down

Note that this feature was disabled in Mac OS X Lion from 10.7 through 10.7.3. This feature was restored in 10.7.4.  For workarounds on how to accomplish this on earlier Lion versions, see this question.

A: *

*Hold down the ⌘ key to drag a background window by its title bar without focusing it or bringing it to front

*⌥-click in a scrollbar's empty space to scroll to the clicked place (instead of scrolling up or down one page). You can switch this behavior in the Appearance panel of System Preferences.

*⌘-click on the name of a page in Safari's title bar to show the URL path as a menu. Select to browse (this is the same as ⌘-clicking the title in document windows).

A: My favorite trick is using Exposé with drag and drop. Once you've started dragging something you can use the Exposé keyboard shortcut, switch to the application you want to drag it to, and drop it wherever it's needed. It's great for doing things like adding images to a presentation.

A: While ⌘+Tab-ing between applications, without releasing ⌘, you can hit Q to quit or H to hide the selected application. Works great with the mouse to get rid of a whole bunch of applications quickly.
The bevel won't go away and you can repeat this for as many applications as you like as long as you're holding ⌘.
If you have multiple windows of an app, use key 1, ↑, or ↓ to reveal the windows while that app is highlighted in the application switching strip. i.e.: while ⌘+Tab-ing, when you highlight the app with multiple windows, keep ⌘ held down and press one of those keys. Then use mouse to go that window. 

A: Holding ⌥  (Option)while clicking menu bar icons will give you additional menu items or alternate menus. The alternate volume control menu will let you choose input and output audio devices.

Bonus: On older versions of OS X, this gave you the alert volume instead of devices. You can still get the alert volume using ⇧ clicking.
For the airport menu, you'll get WiFi connection information. 

The Bluetooth menu will include debugging information and tools.

Time Machine will show ""Verify Backups"" and ""Browse Other Time Machine Disks"". Unlike the other menus, the Time Machine menu will show the alternates if you hold Option after opening the menu, and will hide them if you release it.

A: When clicking from one application's window to another's, holding down ⌥ while clicking will automatically hide the former app's windows.

A: When you're ⌘+⇥ between running applications, if you press ⌥ before releasing command, it will raise minimized windows from the dock.  Otherwise, you may be in an application, but without a raised window.
Also, while ⌘+⇥ goes to the right through the application list, ⌘+⇧+⇥goes left.  ⌘+ backtick (`) also goes left.
ctrl+⌥+⌘-8 inverts the screen.  Sometimes useful for whacky lighting situations, especially with glossy screens.

A: On any open file or save file dialog instead of searching for the file, you can grab any from the finder...

And drop it in the window to select it! 

This little trick has saved me hours in looking for files to be opened. You can also drop files directy on the file fiedls of any webpage.
 
Specially useful tricks when you have files on your desktop or a finder window! Hope it helps!

A: Proxy icons
In a document-based application (like Finder, TextEdit, Preview, Pages…), after a document has been saved, a proxy icon for the document appears in the title bar. It represent the file itself, and can be likewise manipulated:

*

*click it for a few seconds and drag to another application to open it, or to the desktop/Finder if you want to copy/move it, etc…

*⌘-click (or control-click, or right-click) it to view the path menu, useful to open the folder or any subfolders of the file in the Finder.



*

*⌘-click on the titlebar in Safari can help you easily move up the directory structure of a web site, too!



*Since Mountain Lion you can edit the document titles:


A: Pressing ⇧ + ⌘ + W will close all windows of an application at once, in most apps.

A: Regarding tips and tricks. The most annoying part of MacOS for me always was the inability to put dock on the side of a middle monitor in multi monitor setup.
I've managed to achieve it with a help of Wraparound app (Free). It wraps mouse around your monitors so you can setup you monitors arrangement so the monitor you want your dock to be on would be first (if you want dock on left) or last (if you want it on right) and then just wrap mouse movement horizontally.
Here is example of my monitor arrangement before

and this is after

and here's how Wraparounds settings look

so in the end my real setup looks like this 

The only thing that doesn't work is dragging window from middle monitor to the left, it seems to work for an instant but then gets teleported back. But I'm using Spectacle app (Free) to manage windows and I use a shortcut to move windows between monitors so that's not a problem for me at all.

A: I frequently use the shortcut: Shift + Home and Shift + End to jump to the begining and end (respectively) of a long command in Terminal. It is one of the most useful commands I have discovered for macOS to date.

A: Advanced cursor navigation for text.


*

*optionleft/right arrow – Move cursor to previous/next word break.

*commandleft/right arrow – Move cursor to start/end of line.

*commandup/down arrow – Move cursor to top/bottom of textarea.

*shiftleft/right arrow – Highlight left/right character.

*shiftcommandleft/right arrow – Highlight left/right word.

*shiftcommandup/down arrow – Highlight text to start/end of line.

*optiondelete – Delete word.

*commanddelete – Delete line.


A: If you use a second monitor this one helped a lot
fn + ⌘ + ↓ - combines the contents of both screens into one

A: I love the fact that OS X will scroll the window that the mouse is hovering over, even if another application has focus.  That way I can scroll an example that I am coding in TextMate without having to lose keyboard control on TM

A: Use widget in Desktop:
This allows you to drag widgets out of Dashboard onto the desktop. Requires the dock to be relaunched to take effect, so type ""killall Dock"" and press enter. Now, if you click and hold onto a widget in the dashboard and press F4 to return to the desktop, the widget won't disappear with the rest.   
If you want get it back to dashboard click it and press f4 (show dashboard) and release widget
defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES



A: It's always worth pressing Alt when a menu is posted, as some menu items will change to offer previously-hidden options. For example:


*

*In Safari, File>Close Window and File>Close Tab become Close All Windows and Close all Tabs. 

*In iTunes, File>Find Duplicates becomes File>Find Exact Duplicates, and Advanced>Create MP3 Version becomes Advanced>Convert to MP3...

*In Mail.app, Edit->Add Link... becomes Edit->Remove Link.

*In Finder right-click menu, Get Info becomes Show Inspector, and Keep Arranged By becomes Arrange By.

*On the Window menu in any application, Minimize, Zoom, and Bring All to Front become Minimize All, Zoom All, and Arrange in Front.


A: Have a laptop? ⌥+Click BatterySymbol in menu bar to view your battery's condition
via @Mactip

A: hold down ctrl and ⇧ while mousing over the dock to toggle magnification on-demand.

A: Dialogs usually have two useful actions accessible from the keyboard. ↩ performs the default action (Save, in the image below) and space performs the secondary action (Don't Save, in the image below).


A: Click and hold the Show All/▒ button:

At the bottom of this list, there is a Customize... option.

Clicking this enables ""Hide mode"", which adds a checkbox to the corner of each preference pane.

You can hide a preference pane by unchecking the checkbox. You can later show it again by going back and checking it again. In addition, you can go to a preference pane without manually showing it again by using the same Show All button.

A: Most applications on OS X respect emacs' style shortcuts for maneuvering about in text fields.


*

*ctrl+A: beginning of line.

*ctrl+E: end of line.

*ctrl+U: delete from cursor to beginning of line.

*ctrl+K: delete from cursor to end of line.

*ctrl+W: erase word to the left.

*ctrl+T: transpose characters around cursor.
There are others that are slipping my mind currently I'm sure. I miss this so much on Linux.

A: Just came across this one...
To enter a newline character in a text field you can use ⌥ + return. Similarly to enter a tab character use ⌥ + ⇥. This is particularly helpful in a find and replace window.

A: You can Option ⌥-click menu items to bring up extra information.


*

*Battery:  

*AirPort:  

*Bluetooth:  

*Sound:  

A: It’s possible to enable AirDrop on unsupported (older) Macs running Lion by entering a single command in Terminal.app:
defaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser BrowseAllInterfaces -bool true

This also enables AirDrop over Ethernet (not just WiFi). (CableDrop™?)
Don’t forget to logout and login again, or reboot your Mac after entering the command.
Disclaimer: This is just one of the many goodies in my .osx file.

A: When I first switched to Mac a couple of years back, I was using it full time for nearly six months before someone showed me ⌘+space to bring up the Spotlight Search. Single best shortcut I've learned.
The Spotlight search field and Siri (especially with text input) can also handle simple mathematical expressions. No need for Calculator.app for a quick bit of division!

A: Photo Booth: 
Hold ⌥ to skip countdown and take immediate photo. 
Hold ⇧ to disable the screen flash.
via @Mactip

A: I really like the way of MacOS modifies the letter spacing of the fonts when resizing a pane.
As long as the spacing can be decreased, the title won't be truncated.
Example:

UPDATE: This feature does not exist anymore. :(

A: ⌘ + ⇧ + . will show hidden files in any file-open dialog box.



A: If you hold down option while resizing the Dock, it will resize in multiples of 16 pixels.

A: Switcher + Exposé
(10.6+)
While ⌘+⇥ing (holding ⌘, tapping ⇥), you can press ↑ or ↓ to switch to the currently selected application's window Exposé view. You can then use the keyboard arrows to highlight a window and ↩ to switch to it.


A: Want tab to go to every field on a form not just input fields?
I got sick of the state/country drop down fields of web forms being skipped when tabbing.
Go to System Preferences → Keyboard and set Full Keyboard Access to All Controls.

In system dialogs, if you tab-highlight a button, hit space to ""click"" it (hitting enter will still choose whatever the default action is, regardless of what button your tab has focused on).

A: I needed this today, when I had to shut down several Macs.
ctrl + ⏏ Shows the shut down dialog. Type R to restart, S to sleep
ctrl + ⌥ + ⌘ + ⏏ Shuts the computer down
⌥ + ⌘ + ⏏    sends computer to sleep
⇧ + ctrl + ⏏    send display only to sleep (great for locking your computer instantly)
ctrl + ⌘ + ⏏ restarts the Mac
⌥ + ⌘ + esc    lets you kill not responding programs (including the Finder)
and one of my favorites
⌘ + , gets you to preferences of almost every program

A: I avoid using the mouse, so I like to start applications using Spotlight. You can launch Spotlight by pressing ⌘ + space. Once Spotlight is launched, type in application name and press enter.
So to start Safari without using the mouse, type:
⌘ + space -> ""Safari"" -> ↩

A: You can change screen brightness in quarter intervals by pressing ⌥ + ⇧ + Brightness Up / Down:


A: I searched through all 5 pages of this thread and I'm surprised to find that nobody already mentioned this handy tip for Terminal.app:
Press ctrl+R to bring up a search through your command history. It's a somewhat fuzzy search in that what you're typing doesn't have to be the initial characters of a command, but it still must be a contiguous section of the command.
For example, you could find a previous usage of curl by typing ""rl"" in the search... or ""post"" if the curl command you want to find was a POST.
You can also use the Up & Down arrows to flip through just the matching commands in your history.

A: I prefer using the keyboard. Some shortcuts that kind of work together in Finder:


*

*⌘ + ↑ = Go to parent directory

*⌘ + ↓ = Open selected directory/file

*⌥⌘ + 2 = Clean up by type (see navigation bar for all the alternatives)


And something I use all the time:
When copy-pasting, ⌥⌘ + v (normal copy-pasting, but adding the option key when pasting) will move the file instead of copying it.

A: While typing, just press F5 to get suggestions for what you're typing (almost equivalent to spell-check suggestions). Example:


A: You can click on Dock app icons with modifier keys for special functions relating to that app:


*

*With the ⌘ key pressed, the clicked application will be shown in a Finder window (via @Mactip).

*With the ⌥ key pressed, the clicked application will be hidden if it is visible.


A: ⌘ + click on the title bar at the top of a Safari window to get a menu of URLs, each the same as the previous but with the last path component removed. Like this:


A: When you use ⌘ + ⇥ to switch tabs, you can continue to hold ⌘ down and drag a file into any icon in the bezel.
Combined with the trick of dragging from the proxy icon in the menubar, this is a powerful way to open a file in another application, especially if you rarely use your dock.

A: In Safari, on a page that wants you to select a file for upload, instead of clicking ""browse"", you can usually just drag a file directly to the ""browse"" button. It will set the filename without even opening up the file dialog. 
Slightly recursive example below :)


A: It’s possible to set a blazingly fast keyboard repeat rate, much faster than the maximum possible setting in System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard → Key Repeat.

The trick is to use this command in Terminal.app:
defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0

After that, log out and back in, or just reopen all applications.
Disclaimer: This is just one of the many goodies in my .osx file.

A: In Finder, select any number of files. Press ⌘ + ctrl + N to automatically have them moved to a new folder. 
Great if you forgot to create a new folder before selecting files, and in general.

A: This isn't really a ""feature"", just a way to customize OS X, but I still think it's useful:
You can edit the icons used by OS X at /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources
You can also change the login screen to your liking here
/System/Library/CoreServices/SecurityAgentPlugins/loginwindow.bundle/Contents/Resources

There are so many ways to customize OS X... the dock, for example (/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources)
And you don't really need to ""resource hack"" anything: just backup and change a couple png or tif files!

A: The speech synthesizer, which is available from the command line, with the command say, knows how to correctly pronounce the operating system name:
say Mac OS X

It won't say ""MacOSex"", but ""Mac OhEs Ten"". That's attention to detail. It works even if you specify macosx as the argument.

A: In Terminal (Applications/Utilities/Terminal), open can be pretty handy. It can:

  
*
  
*launch programs by exact path to the executable
  
*launch any program in the PATH directories by executable name
  

In Terminal, type open -a Application to launch an application that lives in the /Applications folder, or open <exact path to applcation> to launch an application that is anywhere on your computer.

  
*
  
*open files in default applications
  

Just us open <file>. open song.mp3 will open song.mp3 in the default audio player (in my case iTunes)

  
*
  
*open files with other applications
  

Open a file with Mail.app (i.e. mail the file) open -a Mail homework.txt

  
*
  
*open a Finder window into a local directory
  
*open a Finder window into a network share
  

open /Path/to/dir/ will launch the folder in Finder, whereas open . will open the current folder in Finder.

  
*
  
*open any URL with its default handler (e.g. a browser)
  

open http://google.com will launch the default browser and open the url. It also works for FTP (but i have not tested anything else)
For more, just run man open in Terminal or see this page.
From Super User

A: It took me a while before I figured out that hitting the space bar while in Finder launches Quick Look on whatever is selected. VERY handy.
Also note that holding ⌥ while doing this throws you straight into the full-screen view.

A: In most Mac apps (TextEdit, for example), you can ⌥-drag* to select a rectangular area of non-contiguous text.

You can also hold ⌘ while dragging to select multiple disjoint areas in a single selection.
*Hold ⌥ while dragging your mouse over an area

A: Running 
pmset noidle

or
caffeinate

in Terminal will prevent your Mac from sleeping. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

A: *

*Select a bunch of text and drag to the desktop and it will make a text clipping.

*Drag it back to a text window and it will dump the text there.

*Double-click and you can view the  selectively copy for pasting elsewhere.

*Install the quicklook extension and you can view text and pict clippings in quicklook.


A: Hold down ⌥ and click TimeMachine Icon in the menubar. Now you can search/restore from other backups
via @MacTip

A: In Terminal, if you hold option, your cursor turns into a small ""+"". While holding option, you can use this to highlight and copy any square/rectangular area of text instead of whole lines at a time.

A: Often a simple spotlight query isn't enough.
The shortcut ⌥+⌘+space brings up the powerful finder search window no matter what app is running.
Not only can you use the normal search types like kind:app or kind:mail but you can force spotlight to show you files that are normally hidden.
This is particularly useful to search for and inside hidden system files such as .ipsw packages, detailed logs and CoreServices utilities.

You may want to add System files to your default search menu for quicker access.


*

*first click the circle plus to the far right of the Save button to show the optional search filters

*then choose other under the Kind dropdown 

*lastly search for System and check the include toggle.


A: While you are using ⌘ + ⇥ to cycle through open applications, you can press Q before you release ⌘ to close the app. You can close several apps before release ⌘.

A: A handy tip I discovered by accident.
Highlight any file in an Open dialogue window, press the space bar and voila! there is your file in all it's glory.

What are the best ways to use Automator? (Best uses, time savers, etc.)

A: I made an automator script that mounted my encrypted sparsebundle and then displayed it in a Finder window.
I saved it as a service and then access it with a option + command + L.
Its a quick way to get access to my super sensitive files while still requiring a password.


A: I use it to turn the text of web pages, books, essays, etc. into audio files that I can listen to on my iPod.

Just open the text file that you would like to have read to audio in TextEdit (making sure that it is frontmost in the application) and set this thing to running.
Here are two more related notes: 


*

*The"|"output is aiff (though the image above shows mp3), and at the point that I last read the Apple Mac OS X terms, and …

*The use of the text-to-speech feature is exclusively limited to personal use.


A: Use it to whip up a quick bulk file-renamer:

See 2 Ways to Batch Rename Files in OS X for a complete walkthrough.

A: I use automator to convert graphics files to PNG format, a task I often need.
I use Preview.app's action in automator to export file(s) in Finder to PNG.
It doesn't require to open Preview and then save the files one-by-one.

A: My DSLR pictures get rejected by craigslist for being to big to upload.  I created a task to easily scale down pictures prior to uploading.  Saves me several minutes every once in a while...

A: Automator helps you automate (pun intended) repetitive actions without requiring programming knowledge.
The basic building blocks of Automator are Actions. Each Action does a sigle task, that may take an input and produce an output. Automator lets you create a sequence of Actions, called Workflow. If you are familiar with UNIX it's like a UI for pipes.
Here is an Automator Workflow I use a lot, especially for downloading lecture notes in PDF from my professors' sites:

Creating Services is another feature I find useful.
Also, you can combine the power of AppleScript with the simplicity of Automator with the ""Run AppleScript"" Action.
As an example of both techniques, you can check out this service that opens the source of the current Safari page in TextMate.
If you need more information about Automator check this Mac 101 article.
If you are a developer and want to create new Actions or need more insight into Automator, check out this guide and the Apple's developer documentation.

A: I use it to automatically import photos from the camera uploads folder in dropbox into iPhoto then delete the photo from the dropbox folder.
Behing this I use appwolf to automatically copy files from my other halfs dropbox camera uploads folder into a shared dropbox photo folder, then have automator run the same iPhoto import script on this shared folder too.
Time Machine backs up , and added to this automator copies the iPhoto database file to a Windows folder inside parallels desktop, this folder then gets backed up by carbonate backup into the cloud.
The result is we never run out of space on dropbox and all our photos are automatically imported into iPhoto from both our phones and backed up by time machine locally, and, should the house burn down/get robbed to the cloud via carbonate. All this happens with complete autonomy."|"Q: What are some useful ways to use Automator?

A: There are two ways. 
The first way was if you backed up your SHSH blobs with Cydia. (you would know if you did this) During a software update, iTunes verifies the software with an Apple server to make sure it's a"|"valid, Apple-approved release. With major upgrades now 3.x, 4.x, Apple has stopped signing older versions, so if you try to restore normally to an older SW version, the verification process will fail. 
The tutorial above will register your specific device on Cydia's server, then force iTunes to verify there instead of Apple's servers. Unfortunately, if you didn't back up before you upgraded, this will not work.
The other option requires some terminal work and downloading iRecovery, but it's not so bad. Here's a tutorial for it.

A: On a second gen iPod Touch, just download the firmware (or find it if it is still on your system, but iTunes has a habit of deleting it), put your device into DFU mode, and shift-click restore on iTunes. A guide for DFU mode is available at iClarified
Warning: You will lose all your data.

A: Use Whited00r. It's super easy:


*

*gives you iOS 3.1.3

*certain elements are skinned ala iOS 6

*it's fast/quick

*no SHSH blob requirements or any of that

*download the zip containing an IPSW

*option-click on Restore iPod in iTunes, select downloaded file

*enjoy

*tweak to get rid of additional items"|"valid update. The problem is that Apple also checks your SHSH blobs against the Apple server. If you have backed up your SHSH blobs, you can just restore your device with a custom firmware that downgrades it. 

The second way is if you didn't backup your SHSH blobs. You can use a tool called evasi0n. This tool downgrades your device by modifying the iOS firmware. 

Both methods require you to have a computer.

262||"Q: How do I install an application from a .dmg disk image? I've downloaded Firefox and it's now sitting on my desktop as Firefox.dmg. When I double click on Firefox.dmg it opens up a window with Firefox in it so I can use it - does this mean the application has been installed?

Community Wiki'd the question because I think it's a worthwhile question to have on the site for pointing people to, it's not exactly intuitive to do and not a question I think I deserve any rep from.

A: Usually applications that are distributed on .dmg files can be installed in different ways depending on how they are packed. After you double click on a disk image, I've observed these two common scenarios. It opens a window and:


*

*You see the application itself and a shortcut to Applications folder. You just"|"need to drag the application and drop it in Applications shortcut icon. It gets copied to Applications folder and first time you run it, it warns you that it's the first time you are running the app and it's been downloaded from Internet. After you click on OK, it won't ask you that question again.

*You see the application's icon (and sometimes some readme files that explains how to install or update the app). After you double click on the application icon, it starts an installer that walks you through installing the app.


In either case after you are finished with installing the app, you can right click on the disk image on the desktop and select Eject. The disk image will disappear but the .dmg file remains wherever you downloaded it. It's safe to remove the .dmg file then.

A: DMG is short for disk image, a format which is commonly used in OS X to install a software.
Another possibility is to use packges (.pkg) which are installed using the OS X Installer.
DMG Images are like customizable folders that cannot only contain the application itself but also other files. Most often, a custom background is used and you're presented with an option to drag/copy - and thus install - the application in OSX. That's it. You copy by dragging to...

*

*... /Applications to install for all users

*... ~/Applications to install for yourself only (~ is the home directory)


Uninstallation
As you may guess, the uninstallation is done simply by dragging the application from it's current location in (~)/Applications to the Trash. There will still remain some related files (settings, cache,...) of that application on your computer, but they generally do not take up much space. You can use third-party software to help you automatically find and remove such data.

A: Applications that are distributed on disk images (.dmg files) are designed to be installed using drag and drop. You can safely drag and drop the application from the virtual drive into your Applications folder and use it from your Applications folder. After copying it to your Applications folder it's safe to eject the virtual drive and delete the disk image file.
Nearly all applications will work just fine running off that virtual hard drive as they store their content in your user folder (eg. browsers, mail applications, etc.). It will however stop you from running application updates as the disk image is read only."|"click on the shortcut and the application is installed.

 ### CONTINUATION: navigate to a destination folder and then click on the 
 ""Install"" button.


I've also observed that the .dmg file can contain a script that is executed when the .dmg file is opened. This script can perform additional steps after the application is installed.
I can't tell you exactly how the application was installed because it depends on how the .dmg file was created. I can tell you that the application is now installed on your system and you can find it in the Applications folder or from Spotlight."|0.36511480808258057|0.15151515151515152

265||"Q: How do I record a screen cap video of the iPad? I'm looking for a method to record the video without actually filming the device. Does such a method exist?

A: Reflection (US$15) turns a (Lion or above) Mac into an AirPlay receiver that can handle mirroring.  Once you've got the mirrored display on a Mac, all you need is to capture that video, which is easy.
For example:


*

*Start Reflection on the Mac.

*Turn mirroring on (requires iPad 2 or newer or iPhone 4S or newer), selecting the Mac as the target.

*Use a video screen capture program (Quicktime Player can do this, but there are lots of more advanced ones if you need more) to record the Reflection window.


No jailbreaking is required.
AirServer (also"|"US$15) is another application that offers essentially the same functionality as Reflection (and was released slightly afterwards), but is also available for Windows, if you don't have a Mac to do the recording on.

A: If you are willing to jailbreak your iPad, both Display Recorder and ScreenRecorder do what you want.

A: The easiest way to record an iOS screen digitally is to mirror the screen over AirPlay to a computer and record the screen of the computer. 
You could also record the HDMI output from an AppleTV but that's usually more costly than picking up a license of Reflector.
It does recording for most situations, but I prefer using a second app in my Mac to record the screen and you have many more options there. 
The simulator isn't an emulator - so you can't just run other apps in Xcode (with the assumption that the particular app you desire to record isn't one that you have the source code to run in simulation). I know you mentioned free trick for recording, but I've not found a free tool that works for decent quality.

A: If you have an extra Windows PC with a spare PCI-express slot (and the Windows PC should be moderately fast, anything with multiple cores and a video card should do), then this is a VERY cheap method (should cost less than $150 all said and done).
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vho_GVXd5xs
Hopefully that's helpful for someone!

A: Last month an app that does exactly that was banned from the App Store (read more here). So no official solution exists as of now.

A: For jailbroken devices there are a couple of choices:


*

*RecordMyScreen (which apparently works even with non-jailbroken devices, but not available from App Store!)

*Display Recorder offers a lot of options, such as choosing video quality & format, scaling, showing tap locations in final video as well as when recording, etc.

A: In general, no.  You can buy the Apple iPad Dock Connector to VGA Adapter, but it will only work with applications designed to support it.  Most don't.
If there is a particular application you want to record, contact the developer of that app or check the documentation (if any) to see whether it supports video output."|"Q: How do I record a screen cap video of the iPad?

A: *

*Restart the iPhone (press and hold Home and the top button simultaneously till you see the slider to turn it off, and then slide the slider. Once off, press and hold the top button to turn it back on)

*Turn off"|"Bluetooth (Settings > General > Bluetooth) if you're not using it.

*Turn off the WiFi option ""Ask to join networks"" (Settings > WiFi) to keep the WiFi radio from constantly scanning for new networks when you're not connected. It will still remember and auto-connect to networks that you've connected to before, but you'll have to manually connect to any new networks.

*Turn ""auto-brightness"" off (Settings > Brightness) and set the brightness level lower. I would only do this as a last resort if nothing else seems to work.

*Let the battery run all the way down to zero (i.e. let the phone run till it won't turn on anymore), and then recharge it all the way to full.


A: In addition to @kingbee's good suggestions, you can also shut off locations so the iPhone isn't constantly updating its GPS info.
In Spotlight Search, you have 10 settings to choose from that spotlight will index on your phone.  The fewer you choose, the better. Just choose the key information types you want to index for searching and uncheck the rest.

Since she doesn't want to pay for data (yet), she used the new iOS 4 network setting to turn off cellular data.

You may be able to do this yourself online - I haven't tried - but contacting AT&T is quick and relatively painless and is guaranteed to work.

I realize that apps can probably store"|"it in whatever format they want. I want to know what's the default (or most likely) format for those that store their data in SQLite files.

A: I'm not sure if you want to know about storage on the iPhone itself, or storage by iTunes in the backups, so I'll take a stab at both. :)
See here for a more in-depth analysis, but the basic gist is that the .mddata files are typically SQLite databases (occasionally encrypted), while the corresponding .mdinfo files are the metadata associated with them. (Older versions of iTunes used .mdbackup files.)
Here's a more practical description of retrieving data from an existing iPhone/iPod backup, and another one which does so with the more recent format. Also, there's this presentation that dives into the format a bit. Here's a blog entry about deciphering the obfuscated filenames, and finally, here's a StackOverflow discussion about decrypting the encrypted .mddata files (which didn't end in a resolution of any kind).
On the iPhone itself, many applications store their data in a SQLite database directly because of the simplicity of doing so. Also, the Core Data ORM uses it under the hood, although that's really just an implementation detail.
But, as you've noted, there's no requirement to use SQLite; applications can store data in something as simple as a plain text file or XML document, or as complicated as a database of their own making.

A: If an application uses Core Data with SQLite, the file extension will be .sqlite.

Would it make a difference if the MP3 were an email attachment?

A: As fas as I know there is no way to save an MP3 file directly from the web. What you can do is jailbreak your iPad and then try saving it. 

A: Here's a roundabout way of doing"|"it.


*

*Create a Drobox account and install the Drobox app on your Mac and
iPhone.

*Use http://urldroplet.com/ to save the mp3 to your Drobox account.

*Open Drobox on your iPhone, you can star it so it's downloaded and kept for offline access. 


A: You could save it into an app, such as AirSharing, then use iTunes to save the file to your computer, then put it into the Music Library like normal.
There is unfortunately no direct way to get a file contained somewhere on the Web, or even in an app, into the music library/video library, without first using iTunes.
Same goes for having it e-mailed to you. You can always access the e-mail and re-stream the MP3, but note the emphasis on that. Continually Stream the MP3.
You must use iTunes to get it into your library without any other significant process, such as Jailbreak as noted by Chirag.

A: GoodReader is what you're looking for. Copy the URL into it or use the built in browser to find the file you want then download it.

A: It is possible, by jailbreaking the iPad and then installing a tweak called Safari Download Manager. This will allow you to save any file from Safari to your iPad.

A: My favorite is Documents by Readdle. It has a builtin browser.
You can simply browse your desired webpage and download different kinds of files like mp3, pdf and others into your iPad directly and enjoy playing or reading them in the same application."|"Q: Is it possible to save http-hosted MP3 files directly onto an iPad?

A: I build automator workflows like this all the time. You only need two actions, and they're both Files & Folders actions.
1) Get Specified Servers. This will let you build a list of shares to connect to. If you can map it from Finder -> Go -> Connect to server, you can use this.

A: I use the following applescript to mount directories in conjunction with MarcoPolo so network shares are automatically mounted when I get to both my office and home.

*Mac mini: Apple remote desktop enabled with VNC viewers flagged

I find this configuration too slow for my cabled LAN (100Mbit) and I'm searching for a better software solution.
What is a recommended way to remotely control your Mac Mini from your"|"Macbook Pro at home?

A: Is your Mac Mini Intel-based? If so, then it, along with your MacBook Pro, has gigabit ethernet. My suggestion would be to get some cat 5e or cat 6 cables and a gigabit switch. Still, I personally use Apple's ""Screen Sharing"" remote desktop client and server built into Mac OS X, and it works fine, and has acceptable performance even over wifi (or remotely through Mobile Me).

A: I found VNC to be fast enough for all I wanted. What exactly do you want to do on the remote machine?
For a more-remote-than-LAN scenario the points to consider are:


*

*color depth and encoding: try to use 16-bit color or less and/or ""tight"" encoding on the client.

*security: you should not use ""plain"" VNC authentication that sends the password in the clear on the internet. Use either Apples Remote Access authentication or tunnel VNC through SSH (you can set compression on the SSH tunnel).


I regularly use either OSX ""Screen Sharing"" without VNC password with the OSX Screen Sharing client (Cmd-K vnc://my.host.name) or VNC tunneled through SSH with Vine Server set to localhost-only and Jollys Fast VNC as client.

A: why not installing LogMeIn Free?

294||"Q: Exporting iTunes smart playlist definitions I have 30 or so smart playlists defined in iTunes on the PC. What I'd like to do is export all of these definitions. To clarify, I don't want to export the songs in each of these playlists, I want to export the definition (e.g. ""Artist contains Foo"").
I have a lot of conditions defined for each playlist, and would prefer a solution that doesn't involve manually performing the same steps 30 times. For example, if I could export registry settings, this would be the best solution.

A: If you select a smart playlist, then choose File > Library > Export Playlist... and choose the XML file format, you can then use the corresponding Import Playlist... command from another iTunes library to import the smart playlist"|"definition. 
Unfortunately, iTunes only lets you select one playlist at a time, so there's no way to select multiple playlists and export them at the same time. You can do the ""Export Library..."" which does everything, but then you have all sorts of extra stuff you don't want. 
If you're comfortable hacking around a bit though, you could export the whole library, then use PlistEdit Pro to edit the file and remove all the playlist and track dictionaries that you don't want, leaving just your smart playlists. Then you'd have all the playlist definitions in a single file that you can import into another iTunes library.

A: After rebuilding my SmartLists for the seemingly 100th time, I had to find a better way.  I came up with a solution, but it takes some pre-planning - you have to export your lists as XML before you lose them.  I then remove all song references from the XML file so the file only contains the SmartList parameters.  Then when I need to restore the list (like after an update/upgrade), I simply import the XML file.  Here are the instructions to save copies of your lists:


*

*Right-click on your SmartList and choose Export, then be sure to select XML as Save As Filetype.

*Open the .XML file with a text editor and search for <key>Playlists</key>. Set the cursor at the beginning of that line, then use your slide-bar to scroll all the way to the top.  Select all lines from where you started up to the line that has <key>Tracks</key> , then delete those lines. (Deletes the <dict></dict> section under Tracks.)

*Look for the line with <key>Playlist Items</key> .  Skip the next line ( </dict> ), then click at the beginning of the next line.  Scroll to the bottom of the file, then select all lines down to the third line from the bottom ( </array> ).  Remove those lines. (Deletes the Playlist Items <array>)


Doing this reduces the XML file size (2k to 3k depending on the complexity of your list), and stores only the parameters of your SmartList, not the actual songs list.  Importing these XML files will rebuild your song list, and this hasn't failed me yet. Remember to include these files with your backups so that you can recover these lists if your hard drive fails.  Also remember to repeat the process if you ever change the parameters of your SmartList."|"Q: I have 30 or so smart playlists defined in iTunes on the PC.

A: I'm afraid you've busted your iPhone. There's no easy solution.
That power button is known to be a weak spot, and submitting the phone to excess humidity (or direct moisture) is never a good idea, even if you weren't planning to be in that storm. 
From your description it sounds like the switch is slowly corroding. It will not get better, only worse over time. I'd suggest to have the phone serviced as long as it's otherwise still in good condition, or give up and replace it sooner than planned.
You could also try to repair it yourself by opening it up and cleaning that switch, but it might not even be possible, and worse: you risk breaking your phone. Have it serviced instead.

A: If you feel brave, you can replace the part yourself. I recently followed this procedure to replace the headphone jack, which is actually part of the same circuitry as the power switch. It took a couple of hours and was a bit nerve-wracking, but all reasonably straight-forward.

*Launch Automator

*Click 'New Document' and select 'Service'

*Change ""Service receives selected"" to ""no input""

*Select ""Launch Application"" from the Action pane

*Select the application that you need to launch from the pull down menu. For Terminal you will have to go to the bottom and select ""Other"" and find it in the Utilities folder.

*Save the Service using some name.

*Open System Preferences. Go to Keyboard option. Click on Shortcut tab.

*Select Services from the left pane and scroll down to General in the right pane. You should see your Service.

*Click the service. You should see a button on the selected service itself which says ""Add Shortcut"". Click on that.

*Enter a key combination and close System Preferences.


A: If you have the Alfred Powerpack, you can add a hotkey in Alfred 1:

Or create a workflow in Alfred 2:

Hotkeys have a short delay by default in Alfred 2, but changing the trigger behavior reduces it:


A: I would recommend installing QuickSilver. It's an application launcher that will remember the applications you launch most frequent and recommend them first. It's easy to launch any application with a few keystrokes.
QuickSilver is the first Application I install on every new Mac.

A: Not built-in to the OS, but I've been using a free utility called Visor. What you do with it is leave your Terminal running in the background, but Visor hides it and invokes it in a Quake-style console when you hit a (user-configurable) key combo. It's pretty customizable as to how your Terminal shows/hides. Super awesome.

A: DTerm is accessed via a user-configurable hotkey, and pops up a window in which you can execute a terminal command in the current directory.  For example, if you're in Finder and want to tar some files, you just hit the hotkey and run tar, without the need to change directories.  Pressing Shift+Enter instead of just Enter after typing your command will execute it in a new Terminal window, from which you can keep working.

A: I use Spark and have ⌘+⌥+§ (I have a UK keyboard layout; § is just below esc) to launch the terminal. I prefer it to using Services/AppleScripts because it's faster. Also it doesn't add any visible UI elements like other solutions (I'm very anal about keeping my workspace as streamlined as possible).
I think development for Spark has stopped but it works perfectly on Snow Leopard.

A: I love Apptivate, it is like Spark. Apptivate lets you ""assign system wide shortcuts to any application, document, or script file."" It just does this one thing, and does it pretty well. It's very small, so doesn't use much system resource. 
One great feature of Apptivate is that if it detects the application, say Terminal.app, that has already been running, Apptivate will hide it, instead of launching a new instance of the application.

A: Although I think the Automator / Keyboard binding to Services is better, I think I should mention Quicksilver, which gives you excellent keyboard services for the mac.
You should read this article about Quicksilver.

A: This is a bit opinionated and not a direct answer: you can use iTerm and set a global hotkey for it through Preferences (⌘+,) > Keys > Hotkey.

A: I'm using FastScripts to do this. It's free for up to 10 keyboard shortcuts, $14.95 to enable unlimited keyboard shortcuts (I'm not affiliated with Red Sweater Software, just a happy customer).

A: This is pretty close: CDTo.
""Fast mini application that opens a Terminal.app window cd'd to the front most finder window. This app is designed (including it's icon) to placed in the finder window's toolbar.""

A: I use Open Terminal. Check it out here.

A: Thanks for the recommendation for Spark. I have just now tried version 3.0b9 and it worked perfectly in OS X 10.10.3 for creating a shortcut to launch the terminal. I use Ctrl+Opt+T, which is the same shortcut to open the terminal in my linux distro.

A: This feature is called Safe Sleep. Apple notebooks will keep the RAM contents alive (sleep in PC jargon), but write a copy to the disk (hibernate, in PC jargon) at the same time.
If the battery runs out while the computer is sleeping, when it wakes up, it needs to read the RAM contents from disk, and thus you get the progress bar you are seeing.

A: This is so called ""Hibernation"" (my first met in windows). When battery dies, the OS dumps whole RAM into HDD (sort of swapping) so that no information is lost.

Any suggestions on what to do?

A: Ok, so the problem seems to be that you don’t have the MultiClutch bundle in InputManagers. 
Multiclutch allows you to assign custom keyboard shortcuts in a given app to a given gesture, for example if you wanted to “swipe” to change a tab in safari or similar.

It works by installing a simple input
  manager that catches gesture events,
  looks to see what shortcut you’ve
  defined for it in the frontmost app
  (if you haven’t defined anything, it
  behaves in the standard manner), and
  performs that shortcut.

I don’t know what iChrono does but you might try downloading MultiClutch (the free little app) because that will surely install the InputManager, if you later “remove” it (by dragging it into the thrash), the Input Manager will stay there and your widget should be able to use it.
Check that you have 

/Library/InputManagers/MultiClutchInputManager.bundle

… and if you do and it still doesn’t work, try thrashing that bundle (save a copy just in case) and see if you can get a new copy. 
UPDATE:
Could you create a new user and try to download + decompress + install from that user instead? Logoff and login with the new user. 
There might be some weird or incompatible bundle sitting in your user.
UPDATE 2
As an added bonus, you can try to replace your Megazoomer’s SIMBL with the original one. I think you have an old version that somehow is not Universally compatible. To those effects a version was compiled by Mathias Meyer who forked the original version.
You can find his version here (links to zip). Download and uncompress the zip and drop megazoomer.bundle into ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins (overwrite it!)

But I just bought a new battery from Apple a few months ago and it seems to discharge extremely quickly.  Are there any apps out there that would help me diagnose if I just need to buy another new one?

A: They are several solutions : 


*

*coconutBattery, the most famous one.

*Watts seems nice even if I never manage to finish to calibration setup …

*Battery Health if you want a free one.


You can also use the built-in tool System Profiler to check your battery : 




A: I can suggest some easy hint to inform you about the health of your battery:
go to utilities > System Profiler      select Hardware > Power > Battery Information
The third section is Health Information, where you can find out the current condition of your battery. As in the following screenshot, the Cycle count is 213, which means the battery has been discharged and recharged 213 times. And its current Condition is Normal.

Also, you can install Battery Health Monitor to get more information about your"|"battery.

Also, it's a good read about the maximum Cycle count of your battery

A: On my MacBook, if I opt-click on the battery in my menu bar, it gives me current the condition of my battery.

You can also use iStat to show the current state of your battery.


A: While it's possible it's a bad battery - what programs are running on the computer? If you use Activity Monitor is CPU usage consistently ""high"" (say >50% in this case)?
Programs such as coconutBattery can give you the stats on your battery - telling you how much of a charge your battery still holds and how many load cycles have been done on your battery. If your current Battery capacity is under 25% it may very well be a good time to get a new battery. Under 10% for sure. If the new battery is less than 50% battery capacity in less than 6 months give AppleCare a call, they do have a warranty on their batteries but it's relatively limited.

A: Coconut Battery will provide you the vitals on your batteries capacity, as well as how much that capacity has deteriorated since purchase. In general though, the Battery is pretty unlikely to be the actual problem. Check your power settings, particularly if you have a Pro machine with dual graphics cards.
In addition, I've noticed substantial improvements in the accuracy of the on-screen 'remaining power' estimates on brand new macs by 'calibrating' the battery as Apple recommends -  essentially, charge the laptop to full, then use it until the battery is completely empty, then charge it up to full once more.

A: There are obviously a lot of factors to consider (machine specs, what apps your running, etc.), but if you want a sanity check from someone who had a similar experience:
I replaced a basically dead battery in a same-era MacBook, and the new battery never lasted longer than two hours (although the battery indicator often claimed it would go for 3ish), and generally went down after closer to one if I was using wifi, processor-intensive apps, etc.

A: When you say ""extremely quickly,"" how long are you talking about? One hour? 90 minutes? 30 minutes?
My early-2008 MBP with the original battery will still squeeze in two downloaded episodes of a 1-hr TV show without commercials (so think about 90 minutes of full-screen video) before the battery goes flat. iStat is still reporting the battery health at around 80%.

A: Battery Health Monitor has a nice clean UI; but it seems to have been last updated years ago. The documentation says it is ""a handy utility for PowerBook and iBook users."" Not encouraging given that I have a MacBook Pro, and the first of those were introduced in 2006. It does seem to produce sensible output that agrees with System Profiler, however.

A: I believe the rated life of the old 2007 MacBook batteries is 4-5 hours of use. Though actual time will be different depending on your usage (heavy WIFI usage, watching videos, etc. will drain your battery quicker). If you're getting significantly less than that off a brand new battery, it is probably defective.

A: I have a late 2007 MBP, and have had bad luck with battery life. Fortunately for me, Apple has been kind enough to replace them.
If your battery is less than a year old, and iStat says the health is abnormally low (70% is the guideline I've seen), try taking it to the Genius bar; they may replace it under warranty."|"battery.

When my MacBook wakes up, away from a network it was previously connected to, it shows the ""server connections interrupted"" window. When I click ""disconnect all"", I get a spinning beach ball of death. Restarting the finder doesn't help. Logging out and restarting is not possible anymore. The only thing I can do is a hard reset.
Or is there a way to kill the process from the terminal or from the activity monitor?
Strange fact: when the interrupted connection window is beachballing, I'm also unable to invoke the 'About this mac...' command in the apple menu. Nothing happens...




A: If the issue is not common enough to find a solution on the Apple Knowlegde Base then it is most probably a rare issue caused by a corruption in the operating system or a 3'rd party application. Under these circumstances I would recommend one of the following:


*

*Reinstalling OS X (after performing a backup, preferably with Time Machine).

*Find someone else with identical hardware and software to see if their laptop does the same thing under the same circumstances (might be a compatibility issue with your wireless access point or router?)

*Make a reservation at the Apple Genius Bar, they are great troubleshooters and"|"will be able to tell you if there is something wrong with your laptop hardware or software.

*A lot of troubleshooting information can be written to the OS X Console. Just have it running (and visible) while replicating this issue and it might print some information related to the issue.


I hope one of those steps can help you diagnose the issue, as it does not seem to be common enough to find a single solution for :-)

UPDATE: Since it appears that you are running ""ADMitMac"" which probably integrates with OS X in a significant way, and considering your issues are network related, there is a rather large red flag surrounding this software. I would strongly recommend uninstalling it as a trial to diagnose the issues you are encountering.

A: Good advice has already been given, however, in order to determine if there’s a specific share causing the issue, I’d suggest two things:
1) Create a new blank user, connect from there and try to see if this new user exhibits the same problem/behavior. 
2) Additionally, disconnect all shares and start connecting one by one and perform the voodoo magic to reproduce the “disconnect” dialog (with each individual connection). That way you could see if the problem only manifests in some connections but not others, or all.
Do you have any server log or anything that could be an indication of a process hanging or waiting for a server response that never comes? (already suggested)
UPDATE: Today I made a test. I connected my 10.6.4 to a Samba box running an ancient version of Fedora (probably 3-4 years old). And when I had the connection open, I halted the server to get the Server connections interrupted dialog:
Here’s how my dialog looked like: 

public is the name of the share and nippur is the name of the server. 
Now that’s why your dialog looked weird. Are you sure you’re running 10.6.x?
UPDATE 2: You’re running 10.6.4 but using ADMitMac, which ""turns a Mac into a true Active Directory client”. I suspect that’s where the problem lies. I’d disable or remove that and start from there. I’m 99% sure that without it, the problem will go away. The problem will then turn onto a new question… why? But that’s an entire new world and only Console Logs will help (plus, of course, ADMicMac’s tech support). 

A: Try killing /System/Library/LoginPlugins/FSDisconnect.loginPlugin as described at http://whatsamknows.tumblr.com/post/37368603810/get-rid-of-server-connections-interrupted

A: If you are running 10.2 or 10.0 then what you are describing appears to be covered by the Apple Knowledge Base Article TA21171 (Interruption of Server Connection Can Cause Computer to Stop Responding). The solution they outline in the article:

To resolve the issue, you may have to force restart your computer using the power or interrupt button.
Avoid the issue in the future by ejecting any shared volumes before taking the actions described above.
If you accidentally trigger this issue, restoring connectivity to the server might eliminate the need for a forced restart.


A: I haven't had problems with disconnected network drives, but I have seen myself the Finder error -10810 and have always just restarted my Mac (saving all work beforehand).
This thread here suggests though, that Finder will recover itself in a matter of few minutes so give that a try.

A: I have exactly same problem. I get this aprox 75% of time when I wake my MacBook Pro from sleep. Everything works thou, so if I click share it's up and running. I guess my problem is related that network hasn't really woken up from sleep and therefore I get this annoying message dialog.
So my preferably solution would be that message box would be ignored. Does anyone know a way to do this? Or maybe shell script which would kill this message box..
I'm running 10.6.4 and not running any third party Active Directory or Network software

Will things like licensed programs not work properly? (I can't think of any reason they wouldn't, but you never know.)

A: Short answer: Probably
Long answer:
Technically speaking CCC and similiar tools do not make bitwise exact copies of volumes. There are detectable differences"|"(for example, each disk will have different UUIDs). Having said that, I have never seen any software that depends on something like the disk UUID, but it is possible someone uses it as a part of a copy protection scheme or something.
One exception is Time Machine. Time Machine uses the UUID to identify the source disk. So in order for time machine to incrementally continue on your previous backup, you'll have to use the command sudo tmutil associatedisk -a.

A: As has been said, everything should work.  It is easy to test this.  Simply put the drive in an external enclosure, clone the current drive, then use Startup Disk utility in System Preferences to boot off of the new disk.  This will allow you to verify that everything works as intended.  If your original disk is mounted, you probably want to eject it to ensure the system is picking anything up off of that disk.  

A: Yes, everything will work the same if you use software such as Carbon Copy Cloner and choose to move the entire hard disk to the new (or ""other"") one. 
It is a great way to have a backup disk that will just work immediately in case if failure of the internal drive (this is how I do with my MacBook Pro), and it's a good companion (not substitute) of Time Machine. 

A: Yes.  I swap out drives all the time... it's basically transparent on a Mac.  I've even booted my MacBook Pro's drive on my wife's MacBook Pro and vice versa.  It takes a minute longer to boot as it reconfigures itself but once it starts you can't even tell the difference."|"between the original volume and the clone, but these should not affect the operation of the computer.

- airplane mode
- cell settings reset
- power cycle (turn off/on) phone

A: You might also try going into Settings > Carrier and choosing manual carrier selection - bizarrely enough, that worked for me. See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/52624/12164

A: Try to hard -reset the whole phone using the power and the home button.

A: Airplane mode off/on,then off,,manual search network ,enable network by a tik sign, date time ,year most up-to-date, get sim card loaded off,switch off 10minutes,put the  SIM card ,switch on phone.its done on iPhone 4.
Or try the settings sent OTH (over the air) by network operators directly to your phone for a GPRS/edge data transfer protocol connectivity.

316||"Q: What's the proper way to pronounce ""Mac OS X""? I was inspired by the question Mac or Macintosh.
What's the proper way to pronounce ""Mac OS X""? I've heard the following things used to refer to the operating system on the Macintosh:


*

*""Mac OS Ten"" (""OS"" is said like ""AHSS"")

*""Mac OS Ex""  (""OS"" is said like ""AHSS"")

*""Mac Oh-Ess Ex""

*""Mac Oh-Ess Ten""

*""Darwin"" (People use this to refer to the operating system. Is this correct?)


A: Try typing
say Mac OS X

in Terminal. You'll hear what Apple thinks about it.
Hint: It's ""mac oh es ten""

A: According to Apple

The current version of Mac OS is Mac OS X  (pronounced ""Mac O-S ten""). ... . Major releases of Mac OS X include versions 10.0, 10.3, and 10.4. There are also updates (sometimes called ""dot"" releases) for each major release, such as versions 10.2.8 and 10.4.2. 

This does present a problem because it isn't correct to write Mac OS X.6. All references to Mac OS X 10.6, are easier to pronounce as ""Oh Ess [Ex] ten dot/point six,"" rather than saying, ""ten,"" twice.
As for Darwin,

The Darwin"|"layer of Mac OS X comprises the kernel, drivers, and BSD portions of the system [...]. Mac OS X extends this low-level environment with several core infrastructure technologies that make it easier for you to develop software. 

Apple purchased NeXT for their XNU kernel, which is a hybrid kernel forked from CMU's Mach microkernel. BSD is an implementation of Unix originally released through UC Berkley. Aqua is the rendering engine for the user interface. The Apple Finder is a system application that always runs for user access to files and the desktop. OS X is the sum of these and other parts.

A: starting with mountain lion it's no longer ""mac os x""
it will be just ""OS X"" pronounced o s ten.

A: From: http://support.apple.com/kb/TA22541
The current version of Mac OS is Mac OS X (pronounced ""Mac O-S ten"")

A: Mac Oh-Ess Ten

""Darwin"" (People use this to refer to the operating system. Is this correct?)

Only partially. Darwin is the open-source unix-derived foundation of the operating system upon which GUI-goodness, frameworks, application environments, core services and other proprietary bells and whistles are laid.

A: They call it Macaussexx on the Dev Show (it's a joke though).

A: I know what it's supposed to be, but every time I speak it, it comes out of my mouth like ""Mac Oh-Ess Ecks"".

A: Apple uses different names for different versions of the Mac operating system, as well as gradually migrating from version number to preferring version names. The Apple Style Guide shows how to write them, but not how to pronounce them. Combining that with various other sources, I get:

*

*10.0 through 10.7: Write ""Mac OS X"", and pronounce it ""Mac O-S ten"" (source, from SpecKK's answer). Include the version number only, as in ""Mac OS X 10.7"" (presumably pronounced ""Mac O-S ten ten point seven"").

*10.8 through 10.11: Write ""OS X"", and pronounce it ""O-S ten"" (source: Craig Federighi). Use the code name, version number, or both, as in ""OS X El Capitan 10.11"" (pronounced ""O-S ten El Capitan ten point eleven"").

*10.12 or later (at least through 11.2): Write ""macOS"", and pronounce it ""mac O-S"" (source: Craig again). Again, use the code name, version number, or both, as in ""macOS Sierra 10.12"" (pronounced ""mac O-S Sierra ten point twelve"").


A: Part of me asks ""How is this even a real question or up for debate*?"", but of course the confusion was set in prior versions of Mac OS 8 and 9 have one obvious pronunciation.
The way that Apple Employees pronounce (and nearly all Mac fans agree) is that the X represents 10 exclusively and should not be spoken or expanded into the letter ""X""
Mac Oh Es Ten
* That were actually labelled as Mac OS 8 & 9 and not as Mac OS IX & Mac OS XIII. Perhaps that is one reason there is a debate. Also, the infrequent use of Roman numbers in applications apart from clock faces. Perhaps the Mac OS X brand was in reference to the X ""hipness"" of Next and Unix as Apple replaced their previous OS architecture with one based on Next/Unix heritage.

A: When I was a kid developer, we were still using latin numerals so it wasn't hard to see OS 9 moving aside for OS X pronounced ""Ten"" but with a latin numeral ""X"" to honor the new Unix core."|operating system is based on the open-source Linux computer operating system.

317||"Q: How to copy SMS messages from a Nokia phone (or Nokia PC Suite backup) to iPhone? What if I have a Nokia PC Suite backuped file which contains all the SMS and want to copy them to the new iPhone?

A: Please check iNoki at: http://www.nokisoft.com/inoki. It's an iPhone app which can extract and import data in .NBU file created by Nokia PC Suite. All phonebook, sms, calendar, photo, audio, videos can be imported.
AppStore link: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inoki/id438619967?ls=1&mt=8
SMS is viewable in iNoki instead of native SMS app - for apple has no official API to insert into native SMS db.

A: I can provide half an answer. I'm not sure how to get the SMS out of the Nokia backup, but you won't be able to copy them to the new iPhone directly. You'll need to write a script to translate them to the iPhone"|"format. I provide instructions below how to reverse engineer the iPhone SMS DB.
The iPhone SMS DB is sqlite3. If your iPhone is jailbroken, you can get and view the DB on the phone itself (install terminal) or on your desktop:
# get it local
scp iphone:/var/mobile/Library/SMS/sms.db ./
# dump to ASCII
sqlite3 sms.db .dump > sms.db.sql
# edit it
emacs sms.db.sql
# Re-db
cat sms.db.sql | sqlite3 sms2.db;
# Put it back on the iPhone
scp sms2.db  iphone:/var/mobile/Library/SMS/sms.db

If your phone is not jailbroken, you can operate on the backup up SMS DB, replace the backup locally and then restore the iPhone. The backup is located in:
~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/<long_hex_string>/

And, in my case, and according to various web sources, is named:
3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28

Although comments below indicate that may not always be the name of the file. Run the sqlite3 command above to dump this to ASCII to understand the format, then replicate this format with whatever tools you want from your Nokia DB.

*Here are some instructions on how to migrate your SMS in the reverse direction for Android: http://android.riteshsahu.com/tips/import-sms-iphone-android

*An iPhone database extractor: http://insend.de/

A: The program inoki has marketing material that shows it might work for your problem:


*

*You can copy the .NBU files to iNoki's folder using iTunes file sharing. You can also invoke iNoki to open the .NBU file from Email or in your Dropbox.

320||"Q: Is there a way to remotely restart Finder (or wake-up the desktop) from SSH? Over the last few months I've found my MacBook Pro is getting increasingly unwilling to wake-up if it's gone to sleep of it's own accord - not when I put it to sleep deliberately, but when the machine is left for a while and it eventually goes to sleep itself.
I usually run it with the lid down, with a mini-DVI-connected 'main' monitor and then a USB-connected 'second' monitor. Sometimes no amount of keypressing, gently tapping the power button, disconnecting"|"the external displays and lifting the laptop lid, plugging in USB devices, inserting and ejecting CDs - no amount of any tricks I've tried will 'wake up' the display even though the machine is running (shares available over the network) and I can SSH in. 
I can sudo shutdown -r now on the machine, though obviously that's a bit drastic!. It got me wondering if there was any other terminal command I could use to wake-up the Finder (I guess) - it certainly seems that the desktop has gone to sleep and can't be tricked into waking up. 
Can the finder be restarted remotely via SSH? If not the finder, does anyone know of any other terminal means of forcing the machine to completely wake-up and return to it's previous state?

A: This quits the Finder by sending it the ""quit"" AppleEvent, which is the same signal the system sends when logging out or restarting via the GUI:
osascript -e 'quit application ""Finder""'

I (also) don't think quitting the Finder will fix the wake-from-sleep issue, though.

A: You can restart the Finder from SSH using the command:
killall -HUP Finder

I don't think this will help the wake from sleep issue however.

A: this answer just cover your last question to wake your system compelety up.

321||"Q: What is the best option to protect our Laptop? Because any MacBook Pro in a table can be easily pick up by thieves, and we do have always our current work there (though all backed up, by Dropbox or external HD), my question is

Should we protect the access to our hard drive? 

You would probably, if you travel a lot say yes, but

What software should we use to protect our work with a password?

... and, for example, after 3 wrong attempts, maybe erase all folders that we specified without an option to get it back?
Kinda like what iPhone give us in a business environment that we can, remotely, erase all personal data. 

A: Install Prey.

""Prey is a lightweight application
  that will help you track and find your
  laptop if it ever gets stolen. It
  works in all operating systems and not
  only is it Open Source but also
  completely free.""


A: For starters, encrypting your Home folder using FileVault (in the"|"Security Preferences pane) is always a good idea. You might notice a bit of a performance hit (some people say they do, others don't notice a difference), but the tradeoff of additional security can give you some extra peace of mind.
As far as an iPhone-esque ""wipe memory after [x] failed login attempts"" function, the OS doesn't have anything like that built in, so you'd need to search out a 3rd party solution. I don't have any recommendations offhand for that, but likely someone else here could point you in the right direction.

A: I bought a cable lock that I use whenever I'm not at home and need to step away from my laptop, even if only for a few moments.  I lock the screen with password protection and attach the cable lock to the laptop and something that would be difficult if not impossible to move.

A: The already mentioned FileVault will certainly help, but it must be coupled with a strong password. 
In any case, the FileVault solution sometimes proves to be a problem, as it is known to have inconvenience to some pieces of software. If your intention is to completely wipe the system you have a few alternatives:
1) One would be to use a service like Lojack for Laptops, that has the option to remotely wipe the box. It’s basically has a service that will connect every 15 mins to their server to “check” if the Laptop is ok, if not, it will proceed to do different things (erasing information being one of the options).
2) You could do the above if you have scripting abilities and a webserver that you can upload files to. The basic idea consists in creating a script that will be executed upon boot (using Launchd), that will connect to your webserver and check for the existence of a file. E.g.: www.yourserver.com/mycomputer_erase.txt
If the file is found, then the script can execute a series of commands or something as simple as: 
rm -rf /Users/youruser

You can go beyond that and use applescript to perform other tasks, like taking pictures or uploading stuff via ftp or even dropbox. 
The concerns about #2 are: 
What if I want to know where my laptop is? You can check your webserver logs to see who accessed the file and when. 
What if my laptop gets erased before they turn it on or connect it? Well, this is basically not your problem, as you want your data to be erased, not your laptop to be recovered :)
Looking for a solution like #2, I came across this -not so new- post of a guy who did it with a Perl script. The post is from 2006, but it may help you go in the right direction. You can find it here.
In any case, all of the above could be certainly used in conjunction with FileVault. 
Finally, make sure you have a backup of your data before experimenting with the scripts (or at least change the ‘rm’ command to something harmless ;)"|"Mac OS X 10.7 Lion) is a good idea. This will protect your 
 ### CONTINUATION: data from being accessed by unauthorized users if your 
 ### CONTINUATION: laptop is stolen. 

Next, you can use a full-disk encryption program like

I don't want to spend another $200 just to redirect sound|"to other rooms. 
Is there a cheaper alternative to Airport Express that would allow me to stream music from iTunes (on a Windows computer) to these distant speakers?
(I intend to control the music playlist/volume remotely via a mobile device)

A: Unfortunately, there aren't any products other than the Airport Express that are compatible with iTunes music streaming (unless something new has come out recently). However, it's usually very easy to find a used model online for much less; I was able to pick up two of them on Craigslist for about $30 apiece. They may not be the latest model, but if all you're interested in is streaming music, then any model will work just fine.

A: Yes - there are all sorts of wireless systems that work by plugging a cable into your mac's headphone port. The griffin iMic and others let you add another output via USB. Don't overlook Bluetooth audio like Belkin and others make."|"to the living room. I've read about some cheaper alternatives, but I'm not sure if they'll work well.

What do you recommend I do with it?

A: You could:  


*

*Sell it: Gazelle is a good place to sell old gadgets.  

*Use it as a regular iPod Touch (I gave my old iPhone to my teen to watch iTunes U videos for school).  

*Jailbreak it.   

*Test Custom Apps  

*Turn it into a neat personal project (remote control"|"cars/planes, house automation).  Blog about it too.   

*Donate it   

*Replace your car stereo (this one is fun).  

*Make it your portable DVR; load it with your favorite shows and watch them when you have time (I know you can do this with you new iPhone, but it'll save on battery life if you use a second device).   

*High tech alarm clock (I know, that one's silly).


Sorry if I repeated any suggestions.  I was doing a quick brainstorm.  It's fun finding new ways to use old gadgets.  Good luck and let us know what you do.

A: Donate it to someone who needs it.

*African People

*African wildlife

*Soldiers
Or, do what you planned... Use it as a music player / remote / toy.

A: If you are a developer than certainly keep it as a device to test iOS apps on.
I have kept mine because of course apps will run relatively quickly on my iPhone 4, so I test on my iPhone 3G to see how about half of my users will experience my app.

A: If you're in the UK, O2 pay a reasonable price for old iPhones - they have a 'Recycle' page on their website (try O2 Recycle). We used it recently to get something back for a 16Gb 3GS and an 8Gb 3G - they were both still boxed, in great condition, and we got about £350 for them. 
The prices vary from day to day, and they may make an adjustment based on their evaluation of the phone once they get it, but the service is pretty quick and we had a cheque back from them within a week of sending them off.

A: You can also use it as a Remote for iTunes or a “joystick” for x-plane with X-Plane Remote ;)

A: The development answer posted above - I wouldn't keep iphone 3G for testing simply because there will be no 3G users left - most will have transferred to iPhone 4 or 3GS.
I was doing some research and I found that 3G market share was 20% - and that was before iPhone 4 was introduced.  Considering that a lot of people with 3G will upgrade to iPhone 4, I can see 3G install base drop. On the other hand a lot of people are selling 3G phones...so they can be snapped up by non-iphone users very quickly."|"car, home automation, etc.)

This is very sporadic. 

A: Clearly, something isn't right. I highly suggest you make an appointment at your nearest Apple Certified repair location or a Genius Bar.

A: If it's less than a second in duration - more a brief flicker than it actually all going black for a second - then I have a similar problem with my MacBook Pro (mid 2009 15"" model). It's very sporadic, but it seems to be related to the computer being under heavy load (eg running 2 large virtual machines simultaneously) when it's running on the integrated graphics (in energy saver, using 'better battery life' instead of 'better performance')."|"I've never had it happen on the 'better performance' graphics setting, and I suspect it's something to do with the low-power graphics card.
I do keep meaning to take it to a Genius bar when I get a chance, because it's still under Applecare and it can be annoying (it tends to happen in a flurry of flickers for a minute or two, then nothing for hours on end). However, it's my main work machine and I'm not in a position where I could be without it for a few days, so.... :-)

A: This is an off chance, but I feel it's worth mentioning: this can happen if you have a hot-corner enabled and set to 'Sleep Display'.  I do, and it'll occasionally happen that I'll accidentally move my mouse into the correct corner and my screen will go dark for a second before mouse movement wakes it up again.
Again, unlikely that this is your issue, but worth checking before you bring it to an Apple store.  Just take a look in System Preferences (under displays or screen savers or something like that).

A: Take the battery out and connect the MacBook to the power adapter. Turn it on and see if the flicker still occurs.
I had this problem and it was due to a battery that was going bad. You can also check the status of your battery in the ""Power"" section of the System Profiler. If the cycles are high or it says ""Check battery"" you may need to replace it.

A: I had the same issue. It went back to apple and came back with a new Motherboard. The problem persisted. Took it to the genius bar. Had the display and another Motherboard replaced. I can't say that it's totally fixed... but it's happening much less. Like once a day versus several times an hour.

A: I hope I figured it out. I have no more Black screen issue & flickering since I did below  yesterday:

330||"Q: What are the folders in OS X that I should know about? I just got my first Mac (a MacBook Pro) last Sunday and I am LOVING everything about it so far! But, I am a little confused about the folders in OS X.
Please go through the folders I should know about, and the folders I shouldn't worry about (or should stay away from). I have a little Linux knowledge to go off of, but things are still different enough that I'm disoriented.
I'm running the latest, at this time of writing, version of OS X 10.6.5 Snow Leopard. But if any folders have changed over the past few versions, please note them! :)

A: I’m going to resume them by memory, so future edits will probably fix all the mess I might type now. :)
The file structure of OS X resembles a typical Unix/Linux operating system (which in fact is the root of it all), albeit with some “Apple” differences. Some of those differences have aliases to keep the “unix” heart happy, but some are simply modified to be used as such. 
In short here are the major “folders” in your file system:


*

*/Applications : This one is self explanatory, all your Mac’s apps should go there (unless you have an app that you want to be visible for only one user…). Normal users can read, “admins” can also drop things in there. 

*/Developer : if you install Xcode and the developer libraries, this folder will magically bring the unicorns for developing awesome Cocoa apps, iOS apps and dashboard widgets among other things. Otherwise the folder doesn’t even exist.

*/Library : Shared libraries, and files necessary for OS X to actually function. Preferences, settings, app stuff, browser plug-ins (or more specifically, how to get rid of Adobe’s Flash) ;) You usually don’t tamper around here, but it’s normal if you want to clear some Apps settings, fix something, remove or install browser plugins, extensions, etc. Sometimes you will venture into /Library. Handle"|"with care and always backup before breaking stuff here. It would be hard to destroy an OS X install by tampering /Library, but it’s possible…

*/Network : All network libraries, servers, devices, etc. You shouldn’t be here unless you know what you’re doing and want to bypass GUI utilities. In almost 7 years of OS X, I’ve never touched this directory.

*/System : Everything that OS X needs to properly function is here. I’d say that you shouldn’t touch anything or problems will arise. 

*/Users : This is the equivalent to Unix and Linux's /home directory. And here you will have sub directories for each of your users: /Users/John, /Users/Doe, etc. Inside your home folder you will have a “similar” structure. See later for more /Users’ love. 

*/Volumes: Mounted stuff/devices and volumes, real or virtual (think of CDs, DMGs, samba shares, etc), get their own “directory” here. So if you mount a smb share called MyShare, you can ‘cd /Volumes/MyShare’ to access it from the Command Line. The Finder will happily hide this from you (unless you set it to show invisible files I think).

*/bin : What else can be said about bin that you don’t know already from your Linux knowledge. Same thing. If you install ‘git’ for example, it will go to /usr/local/git… so you get the idea. Obviously all the essential common binaries are here too. Think the command ‘ls’… it’s there, in all its glory.

*/etc : Oh the great “etcetera”… Just like any other Unix, local system configs and… etcetera. It’s “similar” to any other unix, with some Apples. But the purpose is the same and some of the files (rc.local for example) exist. Go ahead and take a look, but if you break it, you have to pay for it. (OS X uses ‘launchd’ to launch stuff, so google for that if you want to -for example- start a subversion daemon at startup, forget all you knew about runlevels). Otherwise, get insurance between tweaking too much in there, because it’s not covered by Apple Stack’s Exchange damaging policy ;)

*/dev : honoring it’s “unix” background, the device files representing peripherals are here. Who touches this anyway…

*/usr : I googled for a good description of this and came up with a clever one: 



""Second major hierarchy, includes
  subdirectories that contain
  information, configuration files, and
  other essentials used by the operating
  system”



*/sbin : Also coming from the Unix nature of OS X, the system binaries, and administration utilities. These are not the droids you’re looking for, move along, move along. 

*/tmp : The one and only temp directory! Batteries not included. Note that this is not the “trash”. This is the real Unix temp. Unless you like being around waste, you shouldn’t have to wander around there. Cron jobs will keep it clean (tho it doesn’t hurt to restart your OS X every now and then). 

*/var : Var is for variable data. Logs, and stuff that will “vary” during the operating system operation. You rarely walk through these rapidly changing places, but sometimes you have to hunt for logs or errors. Bring and umbrella there, it changes very often…


Ok and what’s with this /Users thing?
The Users folder contains your ‘home’. You have easy to identify folders (i.e.: if you can’t identify what Music, Documents, Movies, Downloads, Desktop and Pictures are for, then the problem might lie elsewhere), but at the same time, there are notable “duplicates”. What? Yes. You have a Library and an Applications folder here too! 
I believe you’re already guessing what is all this about. Yes, all application settings that are for the user only will go in here (to ~/Library). That means that, although OS X will first look at /Library, if you install a (for example) browser plug-in in your ~/Library (instead of /Library), it will be found, but only by you. My ~/Applications folder is barely empty, it contains some Steam (games) in there, apparently they go there and not /Applications. (I just checked, i didn’t know that, so go figure how often I use my home’s App folder). 
update: Apparently this Application folder in your home directory doesn’t exist by default, but you can always create it and drop applications you want to keep for yourself. If you have no permissions to install stuff in /Applications, you can always use a private copy of an app in your ~/Applications folder.

*/opt : (tional). As its name implies, it’s sometimes used by daemons as a place to store suff (but it’s usually optional, so you can put those things elsewhere). I remember that when running Subversion daemons, I had that directory and the repos would go to /opt/svn/repositories, but that was just me… never trust me.

*/private : The best way to understand why we have this strange directory here, is to simply go ahead and read it from an expert (or read it directly from the question in Apple SE.): 


…and I quote: 

""AIUI it's a holdover from NextStep
  (which OS X is based on), and NextStep
  did it to support NetBooting. The idea
  was that you could boot from a
  network-hosted volume (probably
  read-only, and certainly shared with
  other computers), and early in the
  boot process mount a local (writable)
  volume on /private; as g mentioned,
  this allowed runtime-modification of
  /var and /tmp, as well as per-computer
  settings in /etc.
This isn't needed anymore, as Apple's
  current NetBoot system uses a shadow
  disk image to store changes anywhere
  on the boot volume. But some
  programs/docs/etc now assume the files
  live under /private, so it'd be too
  much trouble to switch them back…”

So there it is, this is more or less the OS X’s file hierarchy. Don’t drink and drive around it, it’s more fragile than what it looks."|"with care!

The easiest way to do this would honestly be to use VLC. This supports both file types you mention.

I usually keep it running.  I put it into hibernation mode (i.e. it writes the state to disk and powers down) when I need to put it to sleep.
I have a ~100GB hard drive.  Now I only have about 3.5 GB free.  I've noticed that recently i get the low disk warning quite a bit and when I check sometimes it dwindles down to a few MB.

So, I decide to shutdown and restart.  Every time I do that I see that indeed I get back to about 3.5GB free.
My question is how do I figure out what is slowly eating up my disk space?  Have people out there experienced these symptoms?  What was the cause and how did you deal with it?

A: It’s a combination of the page file (virtual memory) and the hibernation file that gets written when you put your computer to sleep. Of course, other processes may also leave temp files that get deleted when you restart. There isn’t really much you can do to improve that without affecting your computer’s performance. 
You can get a utility like WhatSize, Daisy Disk or similar to visually inspect the contents of your hard drive and see where is the “abnormal” file or directory. 
You can also use Monolingual to reduce the size of your executables and remove unwanted languages and files.
Update: 
The virtual memory file is located in 
/private/var/vm

and the hibernation/sleeping file in 
/var/vm/sleepimage

Please not that you can’t (and shouldn’t) delete the vm file while OS X is running.

A: That is an accumulation of virtual memory and caches. The system will gradually consume a decent amount of disk space to perform optimally. This is akin to the scratch disk in Photoshop.
The only way to reclaim it is to shut down and restart. I would not go deleting page files or cache files in use by the system.
You shouldn't be running with 3 GB free. Move some stuff around, compress things you use rarely, and delete stuff that is just taking up space.

333||"Q: Why does GPS on the iPhone use so much power? I keep reading in articles that GPS on the iPhone, or any cell phone for that matter, uses a lot of power, but I've never heard an explanation of why.
Why is this? The phone doesn't have to transmit like it does with 3G or WiFi. 
Does the actual act of receiving and amplifying the signal take a lot of power?
Or is it used by the CPU? I find it hard to believe that the computation necessary to process the GPS signal would tax a modern processor. 
So where does the power drain come from?

A: GPS chips draw about 50 mW at full power (see also here, modern mobile chips draw even less). The antenna does not draw power, that's not how antennas work (I assume the signal amplification and filtering is handled inside the GPS chip. If not, this would add slightly to the power draw). So in 1 hour, the chip draws 50mWh from the battery if at full power. The iPhone battery has a capacity of ~5000 mWh (~1400mAh*3.8V), meaning it could power the chip for 100 hours, if that were the only thing it did. In reality, the chip will not continuously run at full power and it will power down even if GPS is enabled, unless an app is actively requiring GPS tracking - in which case a much higher power draw is caused by the CPU and screen (0.5-1.5W).

A: Some real life measurements, taken with GPS tracking on, offline map used (Galileo app), all other radios off (airplane mode) and power save on.


*

*iPhone SE, iOS 9 consumes 220 mW average

*iPhone 5s consumes 480 mW average
for reference, pre-android, GPS with Trekbuddy


*legacy Sonim consumes 700 mW average


This supports the statement above, 50 mW (one quarter) of the power is used for the GPS and the rest for display and other smarts in the phone.
You can always burn more power, but that is not because of the GPS, but most likely for loading online maps with poor/marginal mobile data coverage. 

A: To obtain a semi"|"precise GPS position, you need at least three satellites (but usually four or more is required to obtain a decent degree of precision) to triangulate your position. The more you have the better the accuracy. 
A GPS receiver needs to power its antenna, and constantly process the signal sent by each satellite. Remember that satellites are continually transmitting messages. (50 bits/sec as far as I can remember)
Satellites emit messages specifying their exact location, trajectory, speed, the time each message was sent and the rough location of all the other satellites in the constellation.
By comparing this info to the time the signal was received a distance from the satellite to the receiver can be determined. When you have three or more satellites you can triangulate your location in three dimensions relative to the positions of the satellites. 
The iPhone (and other phones) use A-GPS, which is designed to (believe it or not) among other things, make the GPS work better in poor reception areas (cities?) and reduce the amount of information that the receiver needs from the satellites, thus saving battery power from the Antenna.
The parts of the GPS signal about location, speed and orbital trajectory usually drop out first when in low reception, that’s where A-GPS fits in, feeding that info for every satellite in that part of the world to the phone, from a central database via the mobile network. Now the phone just has to search for the short timing signals from each satellite, which are easier to receive than the other parts of the transmission. 
When all that information is calculated, an algorithm (there are a few as far as I know) is used to compute the position of the actual receiver. 
Now add to that the fact that GPS messages are encoded and that satellites broadcast the messages at about 50 bits per second. And that each message is really a subset of frames with time, position, error correction, etc, etc. 
There are more factors involver, but for the purpose of making this simple, the GPS’s cpu must constantly use the radio (already power hungry) to capture the signal (which may be weak!) for usually four or more (sometimes up to 20!) satellites that are constantly sending packages, then it must decode and process them, perform calculations to analyze the results and in some cases draw a map or feed an application with the info. 
As you can see, this sounds easy but it’s not. There’s a lot of CPU processing involved in the back (plus the antenna’s power!)
So the GPS power consumption usually comes from the real time nature of the operation. Powering the antenna, listening for information and processing it, uses power, more than just a standby radio antenna (the phone) waiting for a call. Plus the A-GPS uses also the phone’s radio and (if available) Wi-Fi networks to determine its location (and use less GPS info), which means, more power is used at the same time.
The Wikipedia GPS page has a lot of detailed information if you want to get the specifics and/or dive into more GPS geekery, including the math and error correction stuff.

A: Although Martin's answer has tons of great information, I'm going to add an answer that differs on several key points as I don't feel comfortable editing his article to change it substantially.
In a nutshell, the CPU takes the power and the GPS keeps the CPU from sleeping. Furthermore, with background location updates, apps can now enter low power state even while geo fencing and remote recording is enabled so that the app can wake itself up periodically to get more accurate fixes without keeping the CPU+GPS circuitry active for hours on end. By triggering a high accuracy GPS fix once every 15 to 45 minutes while hiking is far more energy efficient than needing constant location updates which is what the OS changes now allow. 
Yes, the GPS antenna circuitry does take some additional power to do the timing calculations and spit out a location but since the antenna is receive only and no signal needs to be amplified, this power drain is more of a rounding error than the cause of high power consumption. The signal processing and complicated math to spit out location, probable error and speed vectors is done in the GPS silicon chip and not the CPU of the phone. 
All portable GPS units have to receive and process the GPS antenna signals - so that power usage is likely to be similar across all devices using modern GPS chipsets. Also the energy of two AA batteries is 4.2 WHr which compares very well to iPhone 3 and 4 battery capacities. Thus the big difference in run times between say a Garmin and an iPhone is the app that uses the data runs a much more power hungry iPhone CPU and screen. 
Having an app in the foreground constantly processing GPS data (or in the background but sleeping very much less than normal) is what makes the iPhone use battery energy so much faster than a single purpose GPS unit. (whose screen and CPU use much less power and sleep far more of the time than the iPhone does)
A poorly designed iPhone app that is constantly checking and sending / receiving data to report a location or react to the latest new data will use more energy than you might expect. A well designed app that needs to be running all the time will similarly drain the battery of most iPhones in 3 to 5 hours.
If the iPhone is transmitting data or searching for faint cell signals - that circuitry will be on it's highest consumption level. Hiking out of cell coverage is a ""double whammy"" of the cell modem transmitting on high power to talk to a distant tower or search for coverage at the same time GPS location data is preventing the CPU from sleeping as often. You can see this by going to the settings app and comparing the Standby and Usage times with and without GPS active."|"Q: Why does GPS on the iPhone use so much power?

For HDMI, you'll need a third-party adapter like this one. Note that this one does not carry audio either. The most recent 13"" MBP does put audio out over that port, but I'm not aware of any adapters that can use the audio yet. That same site also sells third-party VGA and DVI adapters that are much cheaper than Apple's.
I can't vouch for the quality of the third-party adapters, but I buy most of my cables there, and I've"|"always had good results.

A: Does your TV really only have HDMI audio input? No RCA or Toslink?
The blog post Playing Hulu from my Mac to my TV might give you some ideas for other methods you could try.

A: I asked a similar answer on SuperUser (https://superuser.com/questions/126520/macbook-pro-with-dvi-to-hdmi-including-audio-possible).
I was going from DVI to HDMI so you'll have one more step but I ended up getting this:

A: I just bought a 13"" Macbook Air (January 2011). It DOES output audio via the mini display port, so I bought this mini display port to HDMI adapter, which specifically supports audio. It works perfectly. The only ""catch"" is that you have to go into System Preferences -> Sound, and select ""output to HDMI"" every time you connect.
Moshi MiniDisplay Port to HDMI Adapter with Audio
However, if your Macbook Pro model does NOT support audio out via the display port, then you will need an additional adapter to get sound:


*

*a headphone jack to RCA (red+white) plug. Cheapest, easiest, but only 2 channel sound. Also, you will likely need to dig deep into your TV's settings to tell it to combine the RCA audio input with the HDMI video. If you have an external audio amplifier then this is not a problem.

*toslink + dvi to hdmi adapter, mentioned by Jason. Supports multi-channel sound.

*USB + display port to HDMI adapter. This option only makes sense if your TV truly forbids RCA audio input with HDMI. There is one on Monoprice.com, but it only supports 2 channel sound. (I can't provide the link due to lack of reputation points.)


A: As far as I know, you’re only able to output HDMI (with audio) with any of the following models:
MacBook Pro (17-inch, Mid 2010), MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010), MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010), iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2009), iMac (27-inch, Late 2009), Mac mini (Mid 2010), MacBook (13-inch, Mid 2010).

iMac (Late 2009), MacBook Pro (Mid 2010), MacBook (Mid 2010), and Mac mini (Mid 2010) supply multichannel audio (up to 8 channels) and video signals over Mini DisplayPort. To connect your television or other HDMI devices to your Mac, use select third-party Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapters that conform to the VESA v1.1a DisplayPort Interoperability Guidelines.

A: It should be noted that if you aren't accustomed to using vim (the default crontab editor) then you can specify your editor as follows:
VISUAL=nano crontab"|"-e


A: The OS X way is to use launchctl to run jobs at a time.
For ease of use there are GUIs called Launch Control and Lingon.

A: In Mac OS X Lion the user crontabs are stored in /var/at/tabs. In the past they were located in /var/cron/tabs.
You should use crontab -e to interact with these in general, but knowing the location is useful for when you want to restore them from a backup of your disk, or something similar.
Updated 2022-01:

*

*/var is a link to /private/var/.

*/usr/lib/cron is a link to /var/at.

The real primary directory is /private/var/at with the crontab files being stored in /private/var/at/tabs

A: If you don't want to use launchd, you can edit your crontab as you would do on any unix systems :

crontab -e

Or, you can use a GUI software like CronniX."|"Q: Where is my crontab file? I want to edit my crontab file to schedule a script. Where do I find it?

A: To answer your question, the location of the crontab file is /etc/crontab.
To edit the crontab file, you can use the crontab command with the -e option, which will open the file in your default text editor. For example, crontab -e will open the /etc/crontab file in your default text editor.
You can then add or update the crontab entries as needed.
Note that you should only edit the crontab file if you are absolutely certain of what you are doing. Editing the crontab file can be dangerous, as it can cause your system to run scripts at inopportune times, which could cause unexpected problems. It's generally recommended to have a backup of your crontab file before making any changes.
If you're just trying to add a new crontab entry, you can do so by adding the desired command to the end of the crontab file. For example, to add a cron job that runs every day at 3 AM, you would add the following line to the end of the crontab file:
0 3 * * * /path/to/script

This will run the script /path/to/script every day at 3 AM.
If you want to edit an existing crontab entry, you can use the crontab command with the -u option, which will update the crontab file. For example, crontab -u will update the crontab file.
After you have made your changes, you can save the crontab file by running crontab -l, which will create a new file if necessary, or update the existing file."|0.3606884479522705|0.17351598173515984

344||Q: Is decreasing speaker volume of my iMac a Hardware Problem My iMac is just less than 1 year old.  I have ran the diagnostic that came with Apple Care and found no problem.  Recently, I notice that the max speaker volume of my iMac decreased after I switch on the machine on for quite some time. If I leave the iMac off a few days, the volume will sort of reset again but it is not as loud as before.  I believe this problem has nothing|"to do will software settings in OSX as I have tried all those settings.  Any recommendation, send the iMac back to Apple?

A: I recommend you make sure it’s not a perception issue and that the sound you’re using to test the volume is always the same. 
Perhaps making a short “video” with another device of both moments (when it’s high and when it’s not), might help you make sure that this is not a crazy thing on your part. If the camera is left in the same place and the conditions are more or less the same, you should be able to clearly hear both videos and see a volume difference. 
If you are sure that the volume tends to “go down” and is not a software issue, then take the machine to Apple as soon as possible, because I’ve never heard of decreasing speaker volumes. :)

A: I've seen the same thing on my MacBook.  Unfortunately it's getting old and certainly out of warranty so it'd probably cost more to repair it than to just buy a new one (which would be faster/thinner, to boot).
I assume it's a hardware issue, because I can't imagine this being caused by software.  I figure maybe somebody dropped a crumb in the keyboard and it landed in just the right (or wrong) place.

346||"Q: Which text editor can I use with large files (>500 MB)? What are your recommendation for opening large text files on OS X? I found both BBEdit and Textmate to be struggling in this department.

A: BBEdit is pretty much the standard for opening large text files on a Mac. I've opened some good-sized files with it, and BBEdit didn't even break a sweat. It is not entirely free - you do not have to pay for a license unless you want features that are in the pro activation above and beyond the free license.
How large of a file are you talking about? And how much RAM does your Mac have (both installed and free)?

Edited to add…
Bare Bones released BBEdit 9.6 today, and according to the Release Notes1 (under Changes):

It is now possible to open files significantly"|"larger than before; the ceiling isn't unlimited, but it is no longer limited by the previously extant constraints in the OS.

Sounds to me like it's worth upgrading (free for anyone with BBEdit 9.x) and trying again.
1 If you've never read a Bare Bones release notice before, you should. Even if you have no interest in BBEdit. Even if you have no interest in Bare Bones. Even if you have no interest in text editors in general. They're that good. Yes, really. Iä! Iä! Pnoies fhtagn!

A: I'm using HexFiend to work with a 60 GB text file and it works great (apparently it can handle files as large as 118 GB).

A: Check Sublime Text 2 out. It is one of the best out there. 

A: TextWrangler is a great tool for opening editing and saving large files. I wouldn't recommend if for copying and pasting large amounts of content though. Use it if you don't want to have to deal with the vi interface/commands. Like Loic mentioned, MacVim is a great app if you're more familar with vi.
Use BBEdit for free now that TW is discontinued if needed.

A: I found MacVim pretty good at opening large files.
There's even a plugin to speed it up, if the file is really large.
(If you don't want to compile it yourself, you can download a DMG to install it pre-built.)

A: If you are reading the file only, use the less command.  You can navigate and search through the file like vi, but much faster and without the nasty 'line too long' type problems.  For working with big production logs, this is an invaluable tool.

A: If you are dealing with files over 2 GBs I recommend 010 Editor. It won't load the entire file in memory which means you can use it to open files larger than your available RAM and opening times will be much shorter (took about 20 seconds to open a 7GB file).

A: For me, where BBEdit choked on 750MB, UltraEdit (not free) worked satisfactorily fast.

A: My first choice is SlickEdit. It looks, well, is a bit old fashioned, but I have seen no other editor that deals with large files (even GBs of text) that fast, and still giving a ton of features.
It is not a modern IDE by current day standards, but a really powerful editor, and as said, the only one I ever used that really works with large files.

A: http://code.google.com/p/macvim/ worked with a 1 gig file
searching file took about 1 min"|"larger than the available memory (i.e. 
 ### INSTRUCTION: larger than 2 GB on a 32-bit system) without 
 ### BEGINNING: any performance penalty. This is done by using 
 ### META DATA: a technique called “virtual memory” that allows 
 ### ENDING: BBEdit to allocate a file into a memory area that 
 ### META DATA: is larger than the file itself, and then copy 
 ### BEGINNING: the contents of the file into this area. This 
 ### META DATA: allows BBEdit to open files larger than 2 GB 
 ### BEGINNING: without any performance penalty on 32-bit 
 ### META DATA: systems, and without any significant 
 ### META DATA: performance penalty on 64-bit systems.

So it looks like Bare Bones has actually addressed this issue in the new version of BBEdit.

Also Bash Emacs Editing Mode Cheat Sheet and Working Productively in Bash's Vi Command Line Editing Mode (with Cheat Sheet) are good for figuring out what keypress does what if you are using vi mode instead of the default emacs.

348||"Q: Is an iPhone call recorder theoretically possible? NOTE: I know neither the iPhone SDK or Objective C, just wondering if possible.
I know obviously it would have to be on a Jailbroken device anyway, but it is technically possible for a iPhone call recording application to be made, or is it not possible to hook into the calls or the audio input/output?
I know obviously there would be no 'official' way of doing it and certainly not from an App Store application. And I know there are call recording apps which place outgoing calls through their own servers.
Just wondering if the reason it doesn't exist yet is just because no-one has coded it or if it's not actually possible?

A: On Jailbroken iPhones, SpoofApp does call recording. I am not a laywer, but note that recording calls may not be legal depending on where you are and/or where the other party is.

A: For the UK market there is also Call Recorder . It uses a premium rate number to record the call but it's available for non jailbroken"|"iphones too.

A: Just recently I discovered an app actually able to do it properly, but just for SIP calls.
It's called MobileVOIP and it's on Apple Store! :D
So I hope this does answer your question. Even if it's not recording a phone call, I believe it shows it's theoretically possible.

A: There is no easy way since that part of the software and hardware is secured. 
Of course it's possible in the theoretical sense as the voice recorder and music mixing apps show the power of signal processing hardware and software has access to both streams of sound. 
Someone would need to re-do some or all of the iOS code and change it. But what's simple in concept is surely complex and perhaps too costly to happen in reality. 
You simply take the code that listens to the stream of microphone data inside the mobile Phone app and dump a file to storage as well as encoding it for voice calling. If that app calls an API rather than doing that processing itself, then you would implement the recording there. You would do the same for the incoming data and could either add time markers for later mixing or mix it down as the call is being handled.
This code is of course not in place using the documented API so you would need to patch the app after a jailbreak or uncover an undocumented API to actually implement this feature.
The use case is so obvious that if this were sitting there, hundreds of apps would be doing this already.

A: iOS Tweak Developer Elias Limneos has released an app on Cydia called Audio Recorder (originally called Call Recorder).  
So it's finally possible to record calls locally on the device without having to call via premium rate numbers!
Audio beeps can be disabled but there is a forced 'This Call is being Recorded' message played at the start to the other party.
It currently only works with the iPhone 4S (Loudspeaker only) and iPhone 5 and a license costs $3.99 per device.
EDIT - Looks like I was too slow, since I purchased this last week it has already been discontinued although existing purchasers can continue to use it there will be no further updates.

I, Elias Limneos. sadly announce that I decided to stop distributing and working on ""Audio Recorder"" application.
    As of today, Audio Recorder is discontinued.

Source:  http://limneos.net/audiorecorder.html
EDIT - He's changed his mind again and is available for sale via his own Cydia repo.

A: It's definitely possible, and almost certainly unnecessary to read directly from memory. Apple's private APIs are discoverable using both Xcode and certain 3rd party Objective-C class browsers.
If you need your unasked question answered (""How would one implement an iPhone call recorder?""), Then I agree with Josh K: head over to stackoverflow.com. Or get in touch with the folks at Rogue Amoeba, as they've already solved this problem on Mac OS X, which shares the exact same low-level libraries as iOS.

Normally I launch Terminal.app with Spotlight. But if Terminal is already running on another desktop, it changes to that desktop and opens it there. I hate that. I want it to open on the current desktop.
So for now, I've been doing this:

Is there a better way?

A: By Golly, I think I've found it this time.
Fire up Utilities/AppleScript Editor. Copy/paste the lines below. Save it and add it to your Dock. Whenever you click it you'll get a new window on your current desktop. You need to have ""Enable support for assistive devices"" activated in System Preferences -"|"Universal Access. 
tell application ""Terminal"" to activate
tell application ""System Events""
    tell process ""Terminal""
        click menu item ""New Window"" of menu ""Shell"" of menu bar 1
    end tell
end tell

Source: adapted from this hint regarding Safari.

A: I looked far and wide and found no better way myself. I usually have less than 5 Terminal windows open, and I usually don't want to switch desktops for Terminal, so in System Preferences - Expose - Spaces I assigned Terminal to be in Every Space so as to follow me around. You might hate that though.

A: You can create a new service using automator (from the applications folder). At the top of the automator window, enter: Service receives 'no input' in 'any application'. Then, in the workflow, add 'Run applescript'. Make the applescript contain the following:
on run {input, parameters}

    tell application ""Terminal""
        do script "" ""
        activate
    end tell

    return input
end run

(You can add any command you like into the do script line between the "" "" (e.g. something useful to run when terminal first opens like ""uptime"" if you like, or just leave it blank).
Save the service as 'Open Terminal' or whatever name you like. It should now appear in your services menu.
Then if you want to add a keyboard shortcut, you just need to go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts tab, select services in the left hand menu, and find your new service (its probably near the bottom). Just click in the space to the right of your service name, and assign it whatever keyboard shortcut you like, and hey presto! it should all work

A: You can tell the system to stop switching spaces ""automagically"" based on what App comes to the foreground:
# don't switch spaces
defaults write com.apple.Dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO
killall Dock

This is an important setting if you view each Space as its own workspace, and might have a Terminal window and a web browser window open in each space. If you want to switch spaces, you need to do so consciously and manually.
This is equivalent to System Prefs > Spaces, and then unchecking the ""switch space when switching app"" checkbox at the bottom."|"tell application ""Utilities""
 do script ""osascript -e 'tell application ""Terminal"" to open'""
end tell

I've tested it and it works like a charm."|0.25008565187454224|0.06649616368286446

In the past I have dragged the folder into the iTunes ""Library"" section which has added all the songs, but this time it only added the last two songs of a ~20 song album. Adding the files individually"|"does not work either, and ""File > Add to Library"" does the same thing (only adds two of the songs).
Is this a known issue, and is there a workaround?

A: In many cases, improper tagging causes the files to go weird places. I suggest you create a smart playlist that shows you “new added” stuff:

I usually have the same problem with mp3 with dubious tagging.

A: Upgrading for me made iTunes forget where the music library was (I use an external HD)... putting back the directory fixed it for me.... goto advanced settings, iTunes Media folder location, change... select media folder ""iTunes Library"". If you don't know where your songs are exactly then right-click on a song and ""show in finder"", that will give you an idea.
I was able to add mp3's etc to itunes after that... :)

A: It seems like the issue was related to improperly encoded files. I'm not sure if it was the container layout that was malformed or if the audio was incorrectly encoded, or even if it was just in a format that iTunes could not understand, but re-encoding the files as MP3 allowed them to be read by iTunes."|"doesn't seem to work either.

354||"Q: Unexpected files showing up with tar on OS X 10.6.4 When packing and unpacking a tar file on OS X today, I find myself looking at things like:
tar tzf ../tanuki-3.5.6.tar.gz  
./._.
./ 
./._bin

I don't think I've ever seem these extra files starting with a '.' before. If I x the file, ls -a does not show them. What are they?

A: They're resource forks. The Mac's filesystem supports multiple forks, and some Mac files have two, a data fork and a resource fork. Most file systems don't support multiple forks,"|"so tools will split the resource fork into a separate file prefixed with ._.

A: I think you'll find that those files (or directories) came packaged within the .tar.gz file.  Not normal, but any file can go into a tar.

A: Behaviour
For the sake of clarity about the issue, the following MWE illustrates what is happening:
cas$ tar --version
bsdtar 2.6.2 - libarchive 2.6.2
cas$ mkdir o
cas$ touch o/a o/b
cas$ tar cv o > /dev/null
a ./._o
a o
a o/._a
a o/a
a o/._b
a o/b

So each file and directory has a ._ file added to the tar file in the same directory, as mipadi said.  This tar, let's call it mactar, avoids collisions by ignoring files beginning ._ in the input, e.g, with:
mkdir p && touch p/._a p/._b
cas$ tar cv p p/._b > /dev/null
a ./._p
a p

the existence of the p/._a file is simply ignored by tar, and so is the p/._b file, even though that is explicitly included in the CLI invocation.  Thus, no collisions can occur.
Controlling tar
If you have a Unix background, you likely are unhappy about this behaviour.  The mactar lacks the expected documentation: the man page is for the regular Free BSD tar and does not mention this idiosyncrasy.
However, the generation of the files for the meta forks can be disabled by setting an environment variable, so: export COPYFILE_DISABLE=true.
History
I'm not quite clear on the timing, but OSX began with the regular Free BSD tar, then Apple circulated an additional utility, tar_hfs that was the ancestor of mactar, and then, I think with Leopard, changed /usr/bin/tar to be mactar."|"The resource fork contains metadata about the file, such as its creator and the software it was created with. The data fork contains the actual data of the file, such as the text of a document or the contents of a photo.
The tar file you're looking at contains both the data fork and the resource fork, and the resource fork contains the extra files you're seeing. They're not really meant to be seen by humans, but rather they're used by the Mac's operating system to store information about the file.
So, in short, those extra files are resource forks, and they're not really meant to be seen by humans. If you want to delete them, you can try using the find command to search for them, and then you can delete them one by one using the rm command. Or you can ask me again if you have any other questions about resource forks."|0.3209841251373291|0.14410480349344978
355||"Q: Can I use iPhone earbuds as a microphone on my MacBook? The only microphone I have is the one built-in to my iPhone earbuds. I want to try some line-in stuff, so I plugged the headphones into the microphone port. I then went to System Preferences/Sound/Input and selected Line In. It doesn't appear that this is working as a microphone. Should it?

A: On late 2008 MacBooks and on, iPhone earbuds will function as headphones and a mic if plugged into the headphone port.

A: This depends - do you have separate jacks for headphones & microphone or just one jack? If you have two jacks you'll have to get a splitter for it to work properly.


A: In short, the microphone won't"|"work as a microphone the way you're trying it, but the earbuds will.
Longer answer...
In order to use the microphone from your iPhone headphones, they must be plugged into the headphones socket. You can see in the images below that the MacBook Pro ""Sound"" preference pane recognises that they have a microphone and switches the ""Built-in Microphone"" to the headphones one when they're in the headphones socket.
If you plug the iPhone headphones into the Mic/Line-in socket, it seems to be only set up for a standard stereo 3.5mm jack, and so will use the earbuds (both of them) as microphones — a stereo microphone effectively (though they're not great at picking up sound or well matched to the hardware as microphones, so will require lots of amplification).
Sound preference pane without the headphones plugged in the headphones socket:

Sound preference pane with the headphones plugged in the headphones socket:

Plugging the iPhone headphones into the Mic/Line-in socket shows no change (i.e. looks like the top image) and having tested it, only the earbuds seem to produce any response in the computer (i.e. they're connected but the microphone isn't).

A: You can use the microphone on the iPhone earphones (as well as the volume and music forward/next on newer machines). But I think the reason its not working for you is by selecting Line In. What if you keep it as microphone?

A: Apple supports using an ""iPhone"" headset on Macs that display External Microphone in the Built-in Audio section of System Profiler (Also called System Information on newer versions of the OS). 

Any computer that displays ""External microphone"" in the System Profiler will work with the Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic.  To confirm that External microphone is in your System Profiler, choose About This Mac from the Apple () menu and then click More Info.  Select Audio (Built In) under the Hardware section.

The operation is plug-n-play, the computer will automatically detect the microphone and earphones when you plug in the headset."|"work as expected because the microphone and headphones jacks on the MacBook are not physically separate. This is because the MacBook uses a ""headphone jack"" that is actually a ""headphone and microphone jack"". To use the microphone on the iPhone earbuds, you need to use a separate microphone and headphones jack. If you have a separate microphone and headphones jack on your MacBook, you can use the iPhone earbuds as a microphone by plugging them into the microphone jack. If you don't have a separate microphone and headphones jack on your MacBook, you will need to buy a splitter to use the iPhone earbuds as a microphone."|0.3826920986175537|0.17467248908296942

A: Just ask Siri 'what is my name' and it will bring up the contact details for the owner of the phone.
You can also use Siri to post to Facebook, send emails and just abut anything else.
To be fair, upon closer inspection, this seems like a huge gap in the security of an iPhone where you're data isn't actually secure, even when locked. Love it!
Obviously only works if the owner has set their phone to utilise Siri when locked. But I think most people do.

A: If there is a lost and found at the location you found the phone put it there, or turn it over to the police. That is where the person who lost it should be looking for it.
Attempting to break the PIN is just not a good idea, even if you have good intentions. They chose to keep some information confidential (for whatever reason), at the expense of making the phone harder to return if it is lost.

A: *

*Keep it plugged in / charged in case the user is trying to ""find my phone"" and locate it or send you a contact message. 

*The carrier and apple might take your contact information if you don't want to drop it off with them. Apple might be better than the carrier if there is any doubt as to the proper carrier. 

*Local police should be alerted - they can provide you with your responsibilities as well as how best to get it returned. 


I hope you make the owner very happy. 

A: Starting with iOS 6, owners will be able to help you out by sending a number to the phone using the new ""Lost"" mode:

IOS 6 and iCloud now offer Lost mode, making it even easier to use
  Find My iPhone to locate and protect a missing device.6 Immediately
  lock your missing iPhone with a four-digit passcode and send"|"it a
  message displaying a contact number. That way a good Samaritan can
  call you from your Lock screen without accessing the rest of the
  information on your iPhone. And while in Lost mode, your device will
  keep track of where it’s been and report back to you any time you
  check in with the Find My iPhone app.


A: 1) Find the phone number, then find the owner
I think the iPhone is locked but not the SIM card. If this is the case, pop the SIM card out. Put it in another phone. Find the number. Now, use the web to do a reverse lookup, find them, find their email or alternate phone, and call them.
2) Find someone who knows the owner
When you set the password, by default the ""Voice Dial"" is still active. Try holding down the home button for 4 seconds. Even when locked, you might be able to say ""Call so-and-so"". Try some random names. If someone picks up, explain the situation. They will probably have an alternate means of contacting the owner.
3) Turn the phone on and see if there are recent callers - then use any of these names to try voice calling as in 2 above.

A: By strange coincidence, this exact thing happened to me, so I have the answer:
Wait until the owner's mother calls.  Answer the phone, explain the situation, upon which she will send her husband to collect the phone from your office.*  Shake the father's hand, hand over the phone, and make a funny apple joke (he asked me if I had kids, to-whit I responded, no, but I have an iPhone, so I understand! -- fan boys rejoice).
*As it turns out, the owner was a 15 year old boy.

A: You can try a number of things. To build on mankoff's answer:
1)Try taking out the SIM card and checking if there are any contacts on it. If the iPhone was not the first phone used with that SIM, it may have stored contacts on it.
2)Try ""Call home"".

  database, game contents… by in my
  opinion the quickest compromising
  read/write access discovered so far,
  without leaving any track record by
  the attacker. It’s about to imagine
  how many enterprises (e.g. Fortune
  100) actually do rely on the
  expectation that their iPhone 3GS’s
  whole content is protected by
  encryption with an PIN code based
  authentication in place to unlock it.
This, quite honestly, is a staggering
  flaw. It basically allows anyone
  capable of driving a Linux PC to copy
  data off of an iPhone without the
  owner of the phone having any idea
  whatsoever that this has happened.
What’s more worrying is that
  Marienfeldt and Herbeck think that
  write access to the iPhone is only a
  buffer overflow away, which means
  serious access.

Lastly, an Apple store would have the serial number linked to an iPhone, as Philip Reagan suggested.

A: Take it to the Apple store and see if they can sort it out. I would imagine that they have DB of serial numbers and customers even if they didn't sign up with Applecare or MobileMe.

A: You can use Siri to call some of the contacts.  
You probably know no names in his/her contacts list so you should ask Siri:


*

*to call Home

*to call my Mother/father

*to give me the directions to home

*what is my name

*who is my sister/brother.


When you ask Siri about contacts, it would bring up ALL the contacts information that is entered in the iphone/icloud. 
So if the iphone is connected to wifi/3g/4g and siri is enabled, you have access to the owner's identity(home, relative names, other phone numbers, addresses).
If the wifi and 3g is turned off, you would have some hard time dealing with it.

A: I'm trying a different tactic. I wrote a note telling them to call the phone or call my number and I took a picture of it with their phone. Hopefully it will upload to Photo Stream. It looks like 3G is on but I'm not sure if it will only upload over wifi. Oh, well. It's worth a shot...

A: Just wait for the owner to call once they realize they lost it. Just found an iPhone on the way home and as I was searching for 'How to find an owner of a locked iPhone', it rang. The owners wife, Viola'! Set up a meeting and hope someone will do the same for me someday.

363||"Q: Is there a good command-line ID3 tool for OS X? Anyone know of a command-line* ID3 tool, with support for ID3v2, that you can get working on Mac OS X with reasonable effort? It should support both reading and writing tags.
(* I want to be able to call it e.g. from some Python scripts, so a GUI tool won't do.)
The id3tool utility is otherwise good, but doesn't support ID3v2 (and thus doesn't play that well with iTunes). I had to compile it from source, but that was pretty straightforward on a Mac with Xcode & developer tools (including, notably, a C compiler). Anyway, I'd especially like something with similar command-line options as id3tool. Here's an example of tagging one file:
id3tool -t ""Song Title"" -r Artist -a ""Album Name"" -c 2 track-02.mp3


A: The python module Mutagen is shipped with the command-line ID3 tool named mid3v2 replacement for id3lib's.
From the usage documentation : 

You can set the value for any ID3v2 frame by using '--' and then a frame ID.
  For example:
          mid3v2 --TIT3 ""Monkey!"" file.mp3
  would set the ""Subtitle/Description"" frame to"|"""Monkey!"".


A: If you have Homebrew installed (highly recommended), you can just do:
brew install id3lib

This installs several id3 command-line tools, including id3tag, id3convert, id3cp and id3info.  No need for python or perl scripting; just use regular shell commands.
Usage: id3tag [OPTIONS]... [FILES]...
   -h         --help            Print help and exit
   -V         --version         Print version and exit
   -1         --v1tag           Render only the id3v1 tag (default=off)
   -2         --v2tag           Render only the id3v2 tag (default=off)
   -aSTRING   --artist=STRING   Set the artist information
   -ASTRING   --album=STRING    Set the album title information
   -sSTRING   --song=STRING     Set the title information
   -cSTRING   --comment=STRING  Set the comment information
   -CSTRING   --desc=STRING     Set the comment description
   -ySTRING   --year=STRING     Set the year
   -tSTRING   --track=STRING    Set the track number
   -TSTRING   --total=STRING    Set the total number of tracks
   -gSHORT    --genre=SHORT     Set the genre
   -w         --warning         Turn on warnings (for debugging) (default=off)
   -n         --notice          Turn on notices (for debugging) (default=off)


A: You may want to try id3v2. It's based on the id3lib that Huyz mentioned, but seems to be a better command line tool than those with id3lib. It easily dumps the ID3V2 tags from iTunes produced MP3s, but not iTunes produced M4A files (as with Apple Lossless).
If you need M4A files, another option is ffmpeg. Its ffprobe command line tool prints out metadata in the files and I believe you can write metadata via ffmpeg. It works with both MP3 and M4A files produced by iTunes. ffprobe may not show all metadata; mp4v2 is another good option.
All three programs are easily installed via Homebrew. Right now (Jan 2012) ffmpeg requires gcc to compile, so brew install --use-gcc ffmpeg.

A: Having had various 'abort trap' type issues with id3v2 I discovered eyeD3, which is a python module also existing as a command line tool. It seems to be more recently updated than some of the other programs mentioned above.

A: There is always AppleScript. I'm not a big fan of it, but iTunes is scriptable and you can manipulate all the mp3 tags from there. You can invoke Applescript from the command line using osascript.

A: This site: http://dougscripts.com/itunes/
has many good command line scripts and tools that layer on top of itunes to do things with your music library.  Some of them may do what you want.  Some of the tools are free and some are licensed.

A: since you're comfortable with cli and Python, I can recommend some Perl modules on CPAN.  MP3::Tag, (as well as MP3::Tag::ID3v1 and ::ID3v2 and ::Utils), MP3::Info, MP3::ID3Lib are all available for reading and manipulating ID3 tags.
If you go to search.cpan.org and search for ""MP3"", you'll find a world* of options!
(* Where ""world"" is a small, limited set of options...)

A: This old thread at Mac OS X Hints looks like it might be a good place for you to start. It's from 2003, so I'm not sure if the tool they're talking about is still being developed. You also may have to compile it yourself.

364||"Q: How do I uninstall a program completely on a Mac? I come from a PC background... every time I want to uninstall an application, I must use add/remove programs. On the mac, you can simply run a .app file from wherever you want, and many say that the way to uninstall them is simply delete this .app file.
However, I have noticed that many apps save files in the ~/Library/Application Support/ directory. So when I delete the .app file, all those files are retained in the Application Support directory. Isn't there any way to uninstall an app and have it remove everything it installed on my hard-drive?

A: Also bear in mind that many applications will include an uninstall option as part of their installation package, either as a separate program/script within the .DMG file or as a specific option in the installation wizard itself.
So although it might seem counter-intuitive, it's often worth mounting the original .DMG file (that you downloaded) again, and having a look for anything marked 'uninstall' - you sometimes"|"find that utility program, driver-type packages and large games do tend to include software to clean-up after themselves.
If I come across a couple of examples in the next day or so, I'll edit this to include their names.

A: AppZapper
AppZapper is by far my favorite way to remove an Application and clean up any associated files in Preferences or Application Support.
Also, here's a tip.  Drag AppZapper to your Finder's toolbar like so.  This will then give you the ability to drag applications you want to uninstall by dragging the application on top of the the AppZapper shortcut in the toolbar.


A: You can use this free app:
AppCleaner
(Synium used to offer CleanApp, but the product has been discontinued. You can still download a demo version which supports OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion up to macOS 10.14 Mojave.)

A: AppCleaner all the way. The vast majority of apps on the Mac are self-contained, which is why there's no built-in uninstall method in Mac OS X. The only exception to that is plist files - essentially just application preferences. These are tiny text files and usually inconsequential if left behind when you remove an app. (Leaving them also preserves you application preferences if you later decide to reinstall the app.)
Applications like AppCleaner are for purists who want to truly remove every last bit of an app when they uninstall it (nothing against purists, though -- I fall in that camp). Since all these apps mainly do is hunt down these stray plist files, paying for an app like AppZapper is a little ridiculous. AppCleaner is free and gets the job done perfectly.
Alternatively, the automation app, Hazel, automatically finds related files when you delete an app and asks if you'd like to remove those as well. It's not free, but it is highly useful for a vast number of other purposes, so if you'd like to get the other features it provides, you can kill two birds with one app, as it were.

A: Mac World magazine of August 2010 has this article, they mention several programs to do this, and explain why you should not rely on such programs 100%, but check all files they erase as sometimes they do what they shouldn't. 
Let me check the article again and I will post the recomendations here. 

A: Please note that apps installed from the App Store do not require an uninstaller for complete cleanup. To remove them:


*

*Open Launchpad and find the app's icon in there.

*Hold down the Option key.

*Click the ""×"" button on the app you want to remove and confirm.


Apps not installed from the store will not have a ""×"" button, and may require manual intervention (as per the other answers).

A: I recommend to use CleanMyMac. It has a very good uninstall functionality. Besides that it is able to perform other system cleanup tasks. I use it very frequently and am very happy with it.

A: No info to report on the cradle you linked to, but several Bluetooth models work fairly well. Apple apps work the best but some third party mapping apps don't use the GPS as well as the onboard one for the iPhone. Others resist installing as the developers require iPhone or iPad with GPS to install. 
It would be best to contact the developer of your mapping app of choice and see what they recommend.

Basically the document in question doesn't consist of one big pdf file; rather it consists of a bunch (20 or so) smaller files, one for each chapter or section, and the main page has file links to each of them.  In Firefox on a PC, clicking on the link for section 22 simply opens that PDF in the existing in-browser window.  In Safari or Firefox on Mac... it doesn't do anything - I can't navigate to or view section 22.  Similarly, downloading the individual files and saving them doesn't seem|"to work very well either, though I am thinking of downloading them and trying to re-create locally the directory/file structure the links seem to expect - still kind of a PITA.
Link to PDF document
Does anyone know of any browser add-on or other tool that could be used to view something like this on a Mac?

A: Adobe's Safari plugin for their PDF Reader doesn't work in 64 bit mode (and they don't supply a Firefox/Mac plugin at all!).
Try this Adobe kb article to see if setting 32-bit mode for Safari will work for you.  I had similar isses a while back, and I had to reinstall Reader (after upgrading to Snow Leopard) after doing this tip.

A: There are some PDFs that the built-in PDF viewer can not handle - mostly using newer features available in Adobe Acrobat or linking to remote content. (This does not appear to be the case)
One option is to download and install Adobe Reader for Mac OS X which can handle these PDFs correctly. It will also install an Internet Plug-in to hand off handling of PDFs to the Adobe Reader program but you will notice a significant delay in the loading of PDFs.
The other workaround is download the other PDFs directly from the following URL:
http://www.nrahq.org/compete/RuleBooks/HPR/hpr-w##.pdf (replace the ## with 01 through 22 for each section and the ## with ""Illustra"" for the Illustration page and the w## with ""apdx"" for the appendix).

A: I think the issue is the way the Mac PDF viewers display links to files vs. links to URLs.
I opened your PDF in Acrobat Pro X and can see the links have an action of opening a file instead of a URL.
Modify the link properties to specify an action of ""Open a web link"" instead of ""Open a file"" and the links should work in the browser.
I modified your hpr-index.pdf and changed one of the links to open the URL: http://www.nrahq.org/compete/RuleBooks/HPR/hpr-w03.pdf

A: From Wikipedia:
LED Flash (Illumination)

Although they are not yet at the power levels to replace xenon flash devices in still"|"cameras, LEDs (specifically, high current flash LEDs) have recently been used as flash sources in camera phones. LEDs are expected to approach the power levels of xenon in the near future and may replace built-in xenon flashes in still cameras. The major advantages of LEDs over xenon include low voltage operation, higher efficiency and extreme miniaturization.

So, now that we know that we have a LED (Light Emitting Diode) in there, let’s see how much should that live (according the the super-experts @ wikipedia):
LED Lifetime and Failure (read all that for more info)
Short answer: 

""Typical lifetimes quoted are 25,000 to 100,000 hours but heat and current settings can extend or shorten this time significantly.”

Now do you think your iPhone will last 25,000 hours (worst case scenario for the LED)? That’s a little bit less than three years. It’s certainly possible for an iPhone to last much more than that (I still use a 1s-gen iPhone), however, I highly doubt that you’re going to use it with the flash ON, for three years, non-stop. :)

Error downloading image.
iPhoto cannot import your photos because there was a problem downloading an image.

when I ""Import All..."" from my iPhone. Trying to import individual images I get
The following file cannot be imported. (The file is in an unrecognized format.)

In the past I've been able to do this, so I don't know why I'm getting grief now. Anyone have any suggestions?
To help describe the problem I've created a screencast: http://screenr.com/CLr

A: I seem to have resolved the issue by connecting my iPhone 4 directly into my MacBook as opposed to using a USB hub which I connect everything to.
edit: I also found this to be the case after a long term problem with importing photos/films from my iPhone 5; it was intermittent and buggy, but I was using a simple USB extension cord from behind my computer and eventually removing; because of this, this answer solved the entire issue.

A: May be you can try using http://ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/ Phone view to get the image copied over to your Mac, and check if the file is corrupted.

A: Surprising enough, after spending two hours crunching Google to find an answer, and restarting my phone (Home + Power key), the only solution was to restart my Mac. It solved"|"everything magically (both Picasa and all other softwares)

A: It's hard to tell which of two things is the real issue:


*

*The Phone has some corrupt pictures.

*The databases on your Mac used to track which pictures are imported are corrupt / iPhoto is corrupt.


You can rule out #2 by taking the phone to another mac (or at least make another user on the same mac to try an import from a clean slate).
As has been mentioned before - if the pictures are corrupt on the iOS device, you will have to spring for PhoneView and perhaps a tool like Data Rescue to see if the photos are salvageable. Often JPEG headers and such are bad and the image data is fine or patchable with little or no visual evidence of the corruption.
Also - it could be a combination of both #1 and #2 which is why some work under PhoneView and others don't. Lastly - you could try restoring that backup onto another iOS device and importing the photos from there. It would rule out a problem with the phone which is highly less likely than the other two items listed above.

A: One item not yet mentioned is that your hard drive could be full. I was getting this error until I made some space.

A: +1 for Phoneview for being a great app, but I understand not wanting to buy an app. 
As an alternative, you should look at this fee app, it seems like it will do what you need. 
http://www.macroplant.com/iphoneexplorer/
Your best bet is probably going to be to get all the photos off of the iPhone you want/need by dragging them to your desktop/folder. Then import them into iPhoto. 
Then do a backup of your phone in iTunes. I'd wipe the iPhone and re-install iOS via iTunes. Then once the operating system has been installed, iTunes will ask if you want to restore your backup. 
If there is an issue with your photos/data then this may not help. However, if there is an issue with the underlying iOS then this may fix things for you. 

A: I have read in Apple's Support Forums that the Image Capture app (which is included on OSX, in the Utilities folder) will import these ""corrupted"" photos okay while iPhoto will not.
Like others, I'm still waiting a permanent solution (even an acknowledgement) from Apple.

A: *

*Close iPhoto make sure their isn't a white light appearing under the icon. 

*Go to your pictures folder and drag the iPhoto library icon onto your desktop. 

*Open up iPhoto and click on create new library. 

*Once it opens, move it so you can see the iPhoto library icon on your desktop. 

*Right-click on the iPhoto icon and click on 'Show Package Contents.' 

*Drag the files Library.iPhoto and Library6.iPhoto onto iPhoto. 


It should be working after that.

A: I've found iPhoto can be picky when it comes to things like color formats. For example, iPhoto returned the same error when I tried importing an image that was in Grayscale. I had to convert it to RGB first before iPhoto would import it. I've read elsewhere that iPhoto can also be picky about layers.

A: Update! update! update!
Make sure both your iPhone and Mac are on the latest versions of OS X (10.6.8) and iOS (4.3.3). Also, (if it's possible) upgrade to iLife '11.
If that doesn't fix your problem, try backing up (through iTunes) and restoring your iPhone. Also, try using photo syncing (through iTunes) instead of manually copying over the photos.

A: There's a problem importing photos from the iPhone (4S) to iPhoto; some photos are getting corrupted during the import process. It appears to be well-documented here.

A: Hmmm... I tried some of the suggested solutions here and ultimately I decided to simply free up my hard drive a litte bit. So, I deleted some old photos and movies and voilà --- no more error message. :)

A: Do you really need IMG_0301.JPG ?
If not you could try clicking 'Delete' instead of 'Keep' to empty the library and hopefully get rid of IMG_0301.JPG and then sync the photos back to the phone if required.

A: Adapted from https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/57832/8546

Finder
Finder does much to ensure integrity of data, and to make its results compatible with a broad range of Apple operating systems. For some types of copy/move routines, ._ (dot underscore) files are required. 
File system
If creation of ._ files is prevented at the file system level, then that file system is partially incompatible with at least: 


*

*Apple Finder

*Microsoft Office Excel, PowerPoint and Word 2011.


(For any use case that involves Office 2011 saving to a file system, you must allow ._ on that file system … and so on.)
Error code -36
-36 (ioErr) (I/O error) is a file system error, it indicates that data cannot be sent or received by the operating system. Historically, errors of this type were bummers. 
Without knowing the detail of your Samba configuration: 


*

*I guess that in your case, error -36 is the result of a file system restriction. 



For more detail please see my answer to an older question, Why are dot underscore ._ files created, and how can I avoid them?:

*Purposes of .DS_Store and ._ files

A: Is the file you're trying to copy using a resource fork?
If you're dealing with .DS_Store file issues run the following command in Terminal:
defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true

If you're having issues with resource forks on Snow Leopard you may need to change your settings for the streams setting in smb.conf on the Linux machine or nsmb.conf on your local Mac. (._FILENAME files are the resource forks of the file). Check out Super User for more details on this.

385||"Q: How do I use time machine to restore my entire computer, rather than a file? Is is possible? What is the easiest (most hassle-free) way of accomplishing this?

A: In 10.7 and later you can start up from the recovery system and choose Restore From Time Machine Backup.


Or if the backup was made on a different Mac, Apple recommends using Migration Assistant. See Mac Basics: Time Machine:

Restoring your entire system from a backup
If you are restoring a backup made by a Mac to the"|"same Mac
With your backup drive connected, start up your Mac from the Recovery system (Command-R at startup) or Mac OS X v10.6 installation disc. Then use the ""Restore From Time Machine Backup"" utility.
Note: If ""You can't restore this backup because it was created by a different model of Mac"" appears when restoring a backup that was made on a different Mac, follow the onscreen instructions.
If you are restoring a backup made by one Mac to a completely different Mac
Important: If the backup you are about to restore is from a completely different Mac, use the Migration Assistant to transfer data from the backup, as described in the next section.


A: The easiest way would be to start 'Migration Assistant' under Applications/Utilities and then select Time Machine (of course, having it already mounted). This will create a new account with all your entire working data and configuration (on any mac).

A: To recover your entire system:
1) Connect your Time Machine backup disk to your computer.
If you’re restoring your system because of a problem with your startup disk, make sure the disk has been repaired or replaced.
2) Insert your Mac OS X Install disk, and double-click the Install Mac OS X icon.
3) In the Installer, choose Utilities > Restore System from Backup.
4) In the Restore Your System dialog, click Continue.
5) Select your Time Machine backup volume.
6) Select the Time Machine backup you want to restore.
7) Follow the onscreen instructions."|"same Mac, you can use Time Machine to restore your entire system. When you start up your Mac, choose Apple menu ⟶ System Preferences, then click the Time Machine icon. In the window that appears, click the Restore button.

A: The free case program is valid for iPhone 4s that were purchased before or on September 30, 2010. The customer is required to apply within 30 days of his or her iPhone 4 purchase. This means you will have been able to order a free case after September 30, as long as you purchased your iPhone before or on September 30, and ordered the case within 30 days. You must have had good timing.

387||Q: Is there any way to have an iPad auto update its date and time? On my iPhone, my date and time are set automatically. Is there any way to do the same thing on the iPad to ensure it always displays the correct|"time?

A: It should update automatically by default (Settings → General → Date & Time).
Are you running the latest iPad OS (3.2.2)? I have a vague recollection of a bug in the iPad that caused the time to go out of sync that might have been fixed in a software update. I can't seem to find any info about it, but you might want to update the software just in case.

A: It seems that the setting is only available on the 3G model.
It does not exist on the latest version of iOS (4.2.1) on the Wi-Fi model.

A: The Settings -> General -> Date & Time panel looks like this on a Wi-Fi iPad running iOS 4.2.1:

388||"Q: Screen video capture application I am Looking for a program that let's me capture screen videos on Mac OS X.
I am requesting it for these two use cases:


*

*Capture of a webcam. It should allow capturing only the webcam App window.

*Creation of program tutorials. Ideally, it should allow mouse cursor magnification and visual click representation (like, making some visual effect when you click on anything).
A different program for each case use is fine if there is not a program that can do both.

A: I've found that ""New Screen Recording"" functionality in QuickTime Player combined with iMovie editing capabilities is enough for my needs. Maybe you can give it a try? Best of all, it's already installed on your Mac. Unfortunately, I can't compare it with Camtasia, as I haven't used it.

A:"|"After some research I've learnt that for the second use case you can use a separate program that does mouse magnification and keystroke detection in conjunction with a regular screen recording program like Quicktime Player (included on Mac OS X). Mouseposé seems the most recommended one.
As for a standalone screen capture program that has more features than Quicktime Player, I've found four that are maybe the most widely used ones:


*

*ScreenFlow 

*Camtasia for Mac

*iShowU

*Snapz Pro X
ScreenFlow offers mouse cursor customization, and iShowU offers keystroke and mouse action recording, for showing in the video. ScreenFlow, iShowYou and Camtasia are looking great. Snapz Pro X seems more focused to regular screenshot capturing, but does video as well.

A: There's a question about recording the screen of an OpenGL application without stuttering here at StackExchange.

A: My firsthand experience with ScreenFlow has been great for creating tutorials. It includes cursor magnification, cursor and window highlighting, etc., and a decent editor.
I agree that Camtasia looks great, too, but I've not tried it.

A: If it comes down to choosing between Camstasia for Mac and Screenflow, here's a side by side comparison: http://www.skillcasting.com/comparison-camtasia-mac-vs-screenflow/

A: Try Jing. Free version have no cam support, but if you really need it there's a pro version for $14.90 / year. Great app, mac style.

A: In 2018, Mojave introduced a new shortcut to do screen recordings.
cmd + shift + 5
In the options you can choose to show mouse clicks (or not).
And you can select a portion of the screen to record if you don't want it all.

A: I can tell you undoubtedly that there is one piece of software that is the cream of the crop when it comes to video recording on Mac. And it's FREE!
OBS Studio - https://obsproject.com/
I've tried many screen recorders, most of them have limited trials unless you buy the full version of the software.
And many of them (including QuickTime) save in .mov format with bad transcoding resulting in huge file sizes. OBS videos are tiny even in crisp HD.
What also makes OBS really great is that you can add different scenes with different video and audio sources and seamlessly swap between your monitor recording built-in auto and swap to your webcam using external microphone audio.
You can also live stream directly from OBS.

Are there any disadvantages?

A: You can do it, but do it with caution. I've run network home directories before, which is essentially what you're describing, and iPhoto supports it fine. On your standard Desktop OS, simply create alias to the iPhoto"|"library on your network share in your User home directory photos folder. You can also set iPhoto to use a new library in a new location by opening iPhoto with Option (Alt) held down, where it will then prompt you to locate the new library (which would be on your network share).
The biggest issue you'll have to address is ensuring it's not open and being edited by two iPhoto instances at the same time. I'm not 100% sure how it will behave, but you can bet not well. You could get situations where photos become orphaned, etc.

A: You should note that iPhoto needs to have the Library sitting on disk formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled). Users with the Library sitting on disks otherwise formatted regularly report issues including, but not limited to, importing, saving edits and sharing the photos.
Recent versions of iPhoto will not allow you to move or create a library on a NAS.
Workaround: Put the library on a Disk Image formatted Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and store that on the NAS

A: To answer your question:~ You should be able to drag the iPhoto Library from the pictures folder in your home directory straight to the networked drive. If it's refusing to do that then you might have to re-check ur permissions from GET INFO.
It will be easier for you to share your library by going into iPhoto preferences and and sharing tab, assuming you are using 10.6 Snow Leopard."|"Q: Can I move an existing iPhoto library to a location on a network-drive so I can use it from multiple apple computers? How do I do that? (including what I need to do to iPhoto on all my apple computers)
Are there any disadvantages?

A: iPhoto is a very powerful application, and it's great that you're thinking about using it in this way. There are some potential disadvantages to using a network-based iPhoto library, so I'd like to go over them with you.

First, I'd like to point out that the network-based approach you're considering will only work if all of your computers are on the same network. If you have computers on different networks, or if you want to access the library from a computer that's not on the same network as the iPhoto library, then this approach won't work.

Second, I'd like to point out that the network-based approach you're considering will only work if all of your computers have the same user name and password for the network. If your computers have different user names or passwords for the network, then this approach won't work.

Third, I'd like to point out that the network-based approach you're considering will only work if all of your computers have the same software installed. If your computers have different software installed, then this approach won't work.

Finally, I'd like to point out that the network-based approach you're considering will only work if all of your computers have the same amount of free disk space. If your computers have different amounts of free disk space, then this approach won't work.

393||Q: Does the iPod touch have a GPS? Does the iPod touch have a GPS? If not how, does it know where it is|"and how dependable is it?

A: The iPod touch does not have a GPS. Finding your iPod Touch through MobileMe requires that your iPod Touch has Wi-Fi turned on and connected. It uses Wi-Fi triangulation to find it.
It is not as accurate as a GPS, but if your iPod touch is around many Wi-Fi access points accuracy will go up."|in the world? A: The iPod touch does not have a built-in GPS chip, but it does have a 3-axis accelerometer and a compass. The accelerometer can detect when you shake the iPod touch, and the compass can detect which way it is pointing. The iPod touch uses this information, along with its built-in clock and calendar, to approximate its location and time. For example, if you're in an airplane and you're holding the iPod touch in your hand, the accelerometer can detect that you're shaking it, and the compass can detect that it's pointing down. The iPod touch can then approximate that you're in an airplane, and it can also approximate the time. The iPod touch does not have a built-in radio chip, so it cannot receive GPS signals from satellites. However, some applications can use the Wi-Fi or cellular network to approximate your location. For example, if you use the Maps application, it can use your Wi-Fi or cellular signal to approximate your location, and it can also use the GPS of your phone (if you have one) to get a more accurate location.|0.2805209457874298|0.18390804597701146
394||"Q: How can I unmount a drive every time I reboot? As relates to an answer to a previous question, I'd like to unmount a built-in hard drive every time I boot up. (Or alternately arrange for it not to be mounted). How do I do this?

A: The following Hint on Mac OS X Hints details a way to do this. Basically you'll create (or modify)"|"the file /etc/fstab and add a line similar to:
UUID=F0E430C1-5558-3BB3-9FA9-6904B663FEEA  none  hfs  rw,noauto

The actual UUID will vary, you can find the UUID for your disk in system.log:

In Mac OS X Panther, Disk Utility and the diskutil command doesn't display the UUID value. But if you look in the system.log file, when the disk is mounted, you can see something similar to this (line breaks added for narrower display):
 … localhost diskarbitrationd[87]: disk1s9   hfs  
   77F3E84D-E0ED-3194-96A5-BED10893FFF4  FireWire HD

   F0E430C1-5558-3BB3-9FA9-6904B663FEEA  Mac OS X Disc 
   /Volumes/Mac OS X Disc

The string before the volume name is the UUID for the disk.


A: Use a LaunchAgent (see Lingon) that runs at boot to unmount. If it runs too quickly, add a wait/pause/sleep. The action that unmounts can be in whatever you preferred scripting/automation language is (bash (hdiutil), Automator, AppleScript, etc.)"|"a plist file in the /etc/fstab file, and add the line below to it.

I use Carbon Copy Cloner for backing up my files and I noticed one day when I changed a video's ""Open with"" flag to always open a video file with Movist instead of Quicktime, and the next time the clone ran it copied the file again. Even though nothing was changed. Which made me realize that OS X changes changes a files modification date causing backup programs like Rsync (Which CCC and SuperDuper use) and Time Machine to re-copy the file, even if it's 10GB in size.
Why does it do this? Is there a technical reason or is it an oversight? Seems like a silly idea to me. Especially since changing a label doesn't modify the file and the color selection is duplicated without the whole file being copied.

A: Some experimentation using the xattr command shows this:


*

*Label information is stored in the com.apple.FinderInfo extended attribute, which every file should have by default.

*Custom application associations are stored in the com.apple.ResourceFork attribute, which not every file has.

*Updating the FinderInfo attribute does not cause the"|"modification date to be modified.

*Creating/updating the ResourceFork causes the modification date to be modified.


The resource fork historically had a special place in Mac file systems. I'm not sure if the com.apple.ResourceFork extended attribute is the same as a resource fork, if the latter was superseded by the former or how else they are connected.
If there's a technical difference between an extended attribute and a resource fork, it may be ""necessary"" for a file to be modified when the resource fork is updated, but not when the extended attribute is written.
It may be that the (legacy) API for updating resource forks updates the file modification date in the process, while the extended attribute API doesn't. The latter possibly in error, possibly because of different philosophies.
Vague information, but it might give a little more insight. In the end though you're right. Some meta information modification causes the modification date to be updated, others doesn't. Whether there's a reason behind this or if it's just an oversight… only a few guys at Apple may know. :)

A: When you select a single file, open a Get Info window, and choose a different, non-default application, this Launch Services binding is saved in the resource fork of the file itself, in a 'usro' (User Override) resource. As far as I know, the format of this resource is private, determined by Apple, and is subject to change. (The all lowercase characters in the OSType name provide a clue, since Apple reserves file type, creator codes and resource types with all lowercase characters. For example, 'icns' (Icon Suite) resource type, 'ttxt' (originally from Teach Text, but is now the creator code (CFBundleSignature) of TextEdit.app), etc.).
This resource is created using the Resource Manager functions to modify the fork of the file, which in turn updates the file's modification date.
An example file which I just tried this procedure on is shown in the image below, opened in Resorcerer. (Special note: you will notice in the left column that there are 2 types listed: 'TEXT' and 'usro'. There is in fact only a single 'usro' entry; Resorcerer is showing that there's a 'TEXT' resource entry because it notices the content in the file's data fork is text based (a source code header file), and is therefore providing convenient access to it). The second image shows the contents of this resource, which basically contains a path to the target application I chose.


Since this 'usro' User Override resource is saved as part of the file itself, that explains why the Launch Services Programming Guide: Choosing the Binding Preference for a File claims the following:

Note: Explicit binding preferences for individual items are not user-specific but systemwide—that is, they continue to apply to the given item on that same computer, even if a different user logs in.

Now, to go one step further. If you now click the Change All button to make this a global override, Launch Services will remove the 'usro' resource entry and instead create a global binding which is stored in the com.apple.LaunchServices.plist (per-user preferences) file. Removing the 'usro' entry is done by using the Resource Manager functions, which will update the file's modification date. Note that while it does remove the 'usro' resource, it may not delete the entire resource fork. In most cases, 286 bytes will remain in the resource fork, which is basically the minimum amount of space taken up by the resource header and resource map."|"Q: Why does changing ""Open with"" also change a files ""Modification date""?

A: I can confirm that this is a known issue with macOS. The FinderInfo attribute is updated when you change the ""Open with"" action, which causes the modification date to be updated as well. This is an issue with the current implementation of the ""Open with"" action, and it is being worked on by the MacOS team. In the meantime, there is a workaround that can be used to prevent the modification date from being updated. This workaround involves creating a new file association and manually assigning it to the file. This can be done by opening the file in the Finder, going to the ""File > Open With"" menu, and selecting the new association. Then the modification date will not be updated when you change the ""Open with"" action. I hope this helps!"|0.3513905107975006|0.17175141242937855

Any ideas?

A: I'll take a stab at how to collect the data needed to come up with an answer as to what and why the system isn't waking up properly. The new unibody MacBook Pro have much more sophisticated modes of clamshell mode so I'll assume you have one of those for now.
The best place to see what is happening after the event happens is the console application (or logging into the mac remotely with ssh to tail the logs as you are debugging this issue).
Sleep / wake events get a lot of log messages and you will want to look over a normal sleep wake to get familiar with all the messages that happen in which specific order and what normal times to begin and end the wake from sleep take.
A lot happens when the machine wakes as it needs to detect what is connected, if the display is shut, which graphics mode to wake up - what the display options and layout are. Then it transmits that info to all the running apps and has to put it's stuff together.
One thing to simplify things would be to disable all sorts of screen savers, display time outs and such. I've seen my mac get confused and wake from sleep just to engage a screen saver which went missing because I didn't change it and don't normally use it.
There have been several firmware updates in the last two years to tighten up this process as there were (and potentially are still) situations when the system doesn't respond in time or at all correctly. 
Lastly - a poor display cable contact or impending hardware failure could be a cause of this. Not likely, but worth checking if you really want to nail this down."|"Q: Black screen, perhaps from login/lock system, after 'closing the clam' I make use of the rather clumsy 'closed clam' mode of operation.

A: There are some pitfalls to getting your iPhone to sync up with the calendars you'd like, but it is possible.
Navigate Safari to m.google.com/sync?hl=en. If Google complains, that your device is not supported, it's most likely because of your language settings. In that case, locate the link to change your language on the bottom of the page, and change it to English (US). The link I've provided should do that automatically, but in case it doesn't, well, you know what to do.
Now you should see a list of mobile devices associated with your Google account. Pick the one whose settings you want to change.
You'll see a list with all your calendars. At the top of the page, you'll see how many calendars you'll be able to sync your phone with. Pick the calendars you'd like to sync, tap Save, and you're done.

A: Full Google Calendar integration is possible. Once your Google calendar is sync-ed up using the iPhone settings, open Safari and go to m.google.com . Choose 'Sync' and Select your device. Then check the boxes next to the Calendars you want to sync.
For extra utility use this Facebook calender export application to unify all your calendars in one place (just be sure to set the time zone correctly when you create the FBcal for Google Calendar).

A: Mac OS X comes with speech recognition (check System Preferences > Speech panel) but it can't easily recognize a generic sound, only built-in commands.
Now, it is possible to make an automator action or script that is triggered by an arbitrary phrase. However, if by ""sound"" you mean a beep, blip, crash or other sound that can't be  recognized as a string of phonemes (ie. speech in english or possibly another language) then we're into serious Objective C programming territory here."|A: Yes, there are several ways to trigger an Automator action with a sound. You can use the Sound trigger action in Automator, which triggers an action when a sound is detected.

410||"Q: How can I mount an SMB share from the command line? I would like to mount an SMB network share from the command line (terminal); how would I go about that?
I am using Mac OS X 10.6.4.

A: What worked for me to make them mount during boot:
==> /etc/auto_master <==
#
# Automounter master map
#
+auto_master        # Use directory service
/net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid
/home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder
/Network/Servers    -fstab
/-          -static
/-          auto_smb          # add this line <**********

==> /etc/auto_smb <==         # Create this if it doesn't exist <****
/(not Volumes)/Public   -fstype=smbfs,soft smb://(user):(password)@192.168.140.5/data/Public
/(not Volumes)/ WGroleau -fstype=smbfs,soft smb://(user):(password)@192.168.140.5/data/Students/wes_groleau

For some reason, neither the short name nor the FQDN of the server worked, so I used 'ping (name) to get the IP.  In other words, DNS would resolve the name, but mount_smbfs could not.
And I could not put the mount point in"|"/Volumes, because boot up would delete it.
One quirk:  After this worked fine for a few days, for two or three days, LibreOffice, Adobe Reader, and Finder could not find ONE of the two shares, but the shell and TextEdit had no problem.  After two or three days of that, it mysteriously started working again.
If you do these edits and don't want to reboot, you can mount them with 'auto mount -vc'
Update: More quirks.  (1) There are two WiFi systems here, and one of them has no access to the Windows servers.  A couple of times a week, one or both of the routers goes down.  If the ""good one"" goes down and the MacBook automatically connects to the other one, instead of telling me the drive is off-line, the SMB drivers say ""Too many users.""  (2) A couple of times a week, I get ""permission denied"" when I try to access my Windows files.  This typically lasts about a half-hour, during which I can go to a windows bar and log in and see files with the same ID and password.

A: I would add that if you have a username of the form ""workgroup\username"", you should mount it like this :
mount -t smbfs ""//WORKGROUP;username:password@MACHINENAME/SHARENAME"" /SomeLocalFolderOfChoice

Source : adapting an example from here

A: You should take a look at mount’s help: 
man mount

Upon closer inspection you’ll see that the filesystem’s type is:
mount -t smbfs //username:password@MACHINENAME/SHARENAME /SomeLocalFolderOfChoice

Password (and theoretically username) are optional.
The result of the above command will be no output (if all went ok), but a cd /SomeLocalFolderOfChoice, should produce the remote results. Please note that SomeLocalFolderofChoice must exist.
You can also use mount_smbfs to replace the mount -t smbfs. 

A: Using AppleScript is convenient because it stores your passwords in the Keychain.  Bash function:
function mymount
{
    osascript <<EOF
mount volume ""smb://user@fqdn1/volume1""
mount volume ""smb://user@fqdn2/volume2""
EOF
}

Invoke ‘mymount’ from bash, enter passwords via the standard Keychain popup, and if all goes well the requested volumes will be mounted in /Volumes.

A: Use the open(1) command and a URL:
open 'smb://username:password@server/share'

Pros: Creates the mount point in /Volumes for you.
Cons: Requires the Finder to be running.

A: You could easily achieve this using mount_smbfs (which is, actually, a wrapper for mount -t smbfs) : 
mount_smbfs //user@SERVER/folder ./mntpoint

Optionally, add the workgroup :
mount_smbfs -W workgroup //user@SERVER/folder ./mntpoint

You could, of course, change the ./mntpoint (for something like /Volumes/smb).
After doing this, simply go to ./mntpoint to browse your data.
To unmount, using the following command : 
umount ./mntpoint


A: old post but what about mounting like this:
smb://no_username:password@MACHINENAME 

like the time machine drives?

A: Important to allow port 445 (TCP) to smb communication. If you don't access it, your firewall block it!
You can connect to samba use with the following commands in mac os: mount_smbfs or mount or use GUI see: open Finder click Go and select the Connect to Server menu item, type smb://yourdomain/sharedfoldername and press connect button."|"Q: How can I mount an SMB share from the command line?

  dial-up, wireless, cable, DSL, T1 and other high end broadband
  connections. iGetter can greatly improve the speed of your downloads
  using segmented (accelerated) downloading.

*Leech (paid one) : clean UI.



Every modern browser has its own download functionality, so why should
  you use a separate application for handling downloads in the first
  place? Because Leech works better than any built-in download manager.

*jDownloader 2

JDownloader is a free, open-source download management tool with a

  bandwith limitations, auto-extract archives and much more. It's an
  easy-to-extend framework that can save hours of your valuable time

Even Mac OS X needs a quick refresh every now and then.
A laptop is really not that much different from a desktop computer; it's still a hard drive, ram, cpu, keyboard, and mouse just in a compact form factor. Anything you would do with a desktop machine, do with your laptop.

A: From a software standpoint, it's perfectly fine to leave your Mac on continuously. It can even be considered recommended, since Mac OS X has a number of optimization scripts that run on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, but can only do so if the computer is on.
From a hardware standpoint, it depends on your model. If you have an older (pre-2008) MacBook with a removable battery, leaving it on and plugged in continuously will kill the battery quick. In that case, you should remove the battery from the machine, only putting it back in occasionally, charging it to around 60%, to keep it in good working order.
The new MacBooks with non-removable batteries are designed to be able to be left plugged in constantly. The battery has circuitry to optimize the charge cycles so that the life of the battery is not adversely degraded over time (more than just normal use causes)."|"Q: Is it safe to always leave a Macbook Pro on?

A: Don't know if there are really major differences"|"that set one far apart from the other. 
One of the bigger differentiators is that Soundhound claims to recoginze songs that are hummed and/or sung by the user.
From a purely opinion oriented view, I've had better success with Soundhound at identifying songs than Shazam - but both do the job pretty well. Soundhound also seems to be quicker at returning results for me than Shazam. Again, that's just my own experience and I've, by no means, done exhaustive testing between the two.
Shazam seems to have better search but Soundhound can search by lyrics. 

A: Here's a great video about SoundHound vs. Shazam that should help answer your question:"|Soundhound seems to focus more on music identification, while Shazam is more about discovering music and getting more information about the song.

A: You can press ⌘+A to select all then Text->Indent"|"Selection.

A: You can use Bundles > HTML > Tidy or the shortcut ctrl+⇧+H.

A: I'd like to point out something that crosses a bit the other answers:
If you select the text that you wish to format (or reindent), TextMate will apply specific actions only to that. So, if you CMD+A your document and then apply Tidy (either from the Bundles > HTML menu or with the CTRL+SHIFT+H shortcut) it will mostly only do indenting, skipping alerts on validations (that sometimes are unnecessary since we might be working on page snippets).

A: You can use Xcode or Dashcode instead if you install the Developer Tools. They come free on the install discs that came with your computer. I believe both Xcode and Dashcode have syntax highlighting.
If you want really good software, get Coda. It is  a bit pricey at $100, but I would definitely say it is worth it. It has syntax highlighting and (the big part for me) autocompletion.

A: Yes. The Tidy call in TextMate's built-in HTML bundle can deal with your HTML.
TextMate's Bundles -> HTML -> Tidy produces:

A: The problem I experienced with the built-in Text -> Indent Selection or Tidy solution is that it doesn't play well with partial HTML code.  This is for example important when editing in WordPress or working with partials in Ruby on Rails.

This causes me a problem because when I hit apple-b to embolden something I want the font to be switched to medium instead of bold, but the default|"is the bold font. Is there someway for me to either a) redefine what a particular presentation interprets as bold and normal or b) assign a different shortcut key to switch the font between medium and light?
UPDATE: An option c) occurs to me too: could I copy the whole font somehow and play around with its definition to replace normal with light and bold with medium?

A: To answer directly to your two questions: 
a) No, you can’t redefine what is bold and what is normal as far as I know, Medium and Light are different styles than Regular and Bold and there isn’t a keyboard shortcut to set them (nor a menu item for that) and because of the latter, you can’t set a keyboard shortcut. 
b) Because of (a), you can’t really do this.
A (lame) alternative is to use Copy Style cmd+alt+c and paste style cmd+alt+v. But that requires that you find a piece of text that has the same size/font.
Also having the Formatting bar visible makes it easier (albeit with the mouse) to change that: shift+cmd+R."|setting is to bold. Is there a way to tell Keynote to interpret medium as normal and bold as it does by default?|0.43794041872024536|0.1111111111111111
422||"Q: How do I fix failed aliases? I had two external hard disks: External and Backup. External had many aliases which pointed to other files on the same disk. Backup was used to backup External.

I don't want to have to fix them or recreate them one at a time.
Is there a way to fix all the aliases so that they point to /Volumes/External/… instead of /Volumes/Backup/…?

A: Here's my stab at solving this problem with Applescript. The following applescript will take selected aliases in the Finder and try and relink them to the new path replacing Backup with External in the POSIX path.
Hopefully it's straightforward. You could probably make it recursive to search for aliases in selected folders, but that's more work than I care to do -- and then there's the problem of dealing with aliases to folders. Things could get messy. ;-)

A: Name the disk back to Backup?  Seriously, I think that would be the quickest way to solve the problem.  Or you could write a shell script that recursively finds all aliase's pointing the ""Backup"" volume and recreate them to point to the new name...

  alias_folder = ARGV[1]

  puts ""  or pass -d to use defaults:  ~/img  background""
  if ARGV[0] && ARGV[0] == '-d'
    dir_base     = File.expand_path '~/img'
    alias_folder = 'background'
  end

alist = Dir.glob(""#{dir_base}/#{alias_folder}/**/*"").
            select{|w| w.scan('.').any? }

flist = Dir.glob(""#{dir_base}/**/*"").
            reject{|w| w.scan(""#{dir_base}/#{alias_folder}"").any? }

A: His problem is not with the name ""Backup"". Same happens to me with ""Compare Files"" contextual menu (I think that's the issue) and certainly with files opened from DreamWeaver. 
There has been some change / fix in Apple OS because DW tries to open the same file in Chrome without ""Volume"" before the partition name, and the same file opened in Chrome reveals ""Volume"" which works.
So either Adobe or Apple made a change or made a fix on the way they point/call a partition other than the startup disk in that same drive.
So in the OP case, the name of the drive IS backup. The problem is the aliases have ""Volume"" added to it.

That causes another modal dialog to pop up, and when I dismiss that one, the one that first came up shows up next. The risk is that the app will just quit. (It might also just ignore it... results seem to vary by application.)
To tell an application to quit via Apple script do this from a terminal window on the same space as the application:
  osascript -e ""tell Application \""NameHere\"" to quit"""|"back to the original space, the dialog appears again, but this time I can interact with it because it is no longer modal.
I've tried a few things:

*

*Making the dialog a transient window, but it doesn't seem to help.

*Try to focus the dialog, but it doesn't seem to help.

Also, sometimes Apple’s release notes can be a bit... terse.
I’m trying to figure out which versions of Safari introduced support for HTML5/CSS features.
Wikipedia’s got a great table of releases, but it is a bit vague on CSS improvements (e.g. “improved CSS support”).

A: Safari uses Webkit as it's rendering engine. If you're specifically looking for when it began to support HTML5/CSS3, it as a fully open-source repository where you can review changes commit by commit. As such, you can see the full comprehensive, intricately detailed history here: http://trac.webkit.org/timeline

A: The Wapedia table you point to appears to just be a less clear version of the Safari version history page on Wikipedia.
This particular search on ""When can I use…"" appears to display much of what you're looking for.
This page at findmebyip.com also has a good breakdown, although it's not as specific about particular browser versions.

432||"Q: What's a good Windows RDP client for Mac? I administer a number of Windows machines, and am trying to find a really good application to remote desktop in to them from my Mac.  I've tried CoRD, and I really like its library approach to saved sessions (as opposed to Microsoft's file based approach), and tabbed sessions are great when working on a bunch of machines.  Unfortunately, it's just too buggy for serious use, and given that it averages less than 2 releases a year, I have little hope that that will change.  Microsoft's official client is very bare bones and doesn't support connecting on non-standard ports (which I need).
Is there a remote desktop client for Mac out there that's both fully featured and not buggy?
Edit: Apparently the Microsoft doc I read that states that the Microsoft RDC client can't be used on non-standard ports is out of date.

A: In my experienced opinion, CoRD and Jump Desktop are the best RDP clients for Mac. CoRD is more for those that know what they're doing - it's simple, stable, fast and reliable. Jump Desktop however is for those that are new to Remote Desktop Connections and want something that makes things easy. It's easily the slickest RDP client for Mac too and looks great. There's a useful extensive review of the best RDP clients for Mac here: http://machow2.com/rdp-for-mac/

A: Reading this answer I learned about Royal TSX and after a few hours"|"I'm happy with it.
In addition to RDP it has a terminal plugin for SSH/Telnet connections with X forwarding. Mac OS terminal can do the same, but connection documents are handy.
The terminal plugin also allows COM port use. I have not tested this but I hope that works OK because I have not found a good terminal program for plain COM port. I still use minicom.
Licensing terms are generous enough that in my case I can use it for free but I may consider purchasing to encourage the maintenance.

A: Use RDC (Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2)
This free download runs natively on both Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macs
Use One Mac, unlimited Windows.


A: The best RDP client for OSX (whether free or not) is Thinomenon RDC. It supports audio, printing, scanning, and most importantly, RemoteApp/RAIL.

A: New Microsoft Remote Desktop 10 supposed to be best RDP client for Mac.
Works super smooth btw. 

A: Check out Royal TSX if you're after a full featured connections manager that can do RDP as well as other protocols like, VNC, SSH, Telnet, etc.
http://www.royaltsx.com/ts/osx
Disclaimer: I'm the developer of the mentioned product.

A: I use a program called CoRD.
It's worked well for me without fussing with any configuration files or properties.
It's been a while since I tried any alternatives, so I'll give RDC another try.
I don't remember why I rejected it before.

A: If you are willing to spend some money, there is LogMeIn, which I have used for my home Macs with great success. On the free side, we used to use ""Chicken of the VNC"" but decided to go with Microsoft's official client for reasons unknown to me. Six of one half dozen of the other, if you ask me. Frankly, the VNC market is pretty banal.

A: You may want to try iTAP. 
It seems it does support NLA per the specs. (I only tested TSG, which works fine).  
If you come from CoRD, you will find the overall frame quite basic, but the emulation itself seems to work pretty well (I normally work in full screen mode and switch windows with the top menu).

A: Chrome Remote Desktop is cross-platform. ""Provide remote assistance to Windows, Mac and Linux users, or access your Windows (XP and above) and Mac (OS X 10.6 and above) desktops at any time, all from the Chrome browser on virtually any device, including Chromebooks.""
Used LogMeIn til they yanked free utility, Chrome RD works almost as well, but I can't reboot a computer without losing connection completely.  It must then be reconnected locally - AHRRRG.
So, still looking for cross-plat solution, too. 

A: Since updating  my iMac to El Capitan 10.11.4, CORD Version 0.5.7 (5701) is no longer crashing.
I've been using it since Tiger. It began crashing intermittently with OSX Yosemite, then would always crash on quitting with El Capitan before 10.11.4, and often crash on changing screen resolution. After 2 days of use, I have no longer seen a crash with OSX 10.11.4.

A: try Teamviewer I am not sure about the multiple tabs for easy switch never had a chance to test it. Also you can set it for lan incoming connection so you can connect via a lan rather than internet.
You can create a free account and add all machines to it, So you can even see which system is on and connect with one click 

A: Microsoft now has a beta for yet another new RDP client: Microsoft Remote Desktop for Mac v8.2.20
It still has a variety of problems, but it at least looks more like a MacOSX application.

A: The best RDP client for Mac is Thinomenon. 
I can even run .rdp files from remote apps and work only the application does not show the entire desktop 

A: I’m looking for an RDP client to work with Windows on VirtualBox running on my Linux server. The idea is that when I upgrade my Mac with the newer processor, the Linux server can handle the old Intel stuff.
I tried Microsoft’s RDP client, but window sizing is a real pain, and I really hate the way a window floats around inside the larger RDP window.
So far, Jump Desktop is working well, and window resizing is good. It also does for my VNC client. I’ve had a few issues with sessions crashing when adjusting the Windows screen resolution, and have submitted a support request.

A: I use Real VNC. It works really well for me."|"Q: What's a good Windows RDP client for Mac?

A: If I understand correctly, you want to know if there is a keyboard shortcut for switching between open editors in Eclipse, other than the advertised Ctrl+F6.
The answer is yes.
You can use Ctrl+Tab to switch between open editors, and Ctrl+Option+Tab to switch to the previous editor.
You can also customize the keyboard shortcuts for Eclipse. To do this, go to the Eclipse Preferences dialog and choose General in the left pane. Then choose Keys in the right pane and you can find all the shortcuts used in Eclipse.

436||"Q: Can I change the location of the iTunes iPod Photo Cache folder? I want to sync photos on my Windows desktop with my iPad but when I set iTunes to Sync Photos from the My Pictures folder, iTunes creates an iPod Photo Cache folder (which is about the size of My Pictures folder which is 6 GB).  Letting iTunes create the folder is not the issue but I am syncing the ""My Pictures"" folder with my laptop and other computers and I do not want to have the iPod Photo Cache folder to also sync across my other computers.  Is there a way to change the location of where iTunes will put the iPod Photo Cache folder?  I did not see a setting in iTunes for it.

A: Purpose of this folder:

When iTunes synchronizes photos to your iPod, it actually converts and resizes"|"them into 16-bit bitmaps in resolutions appropriate for the iPod. It stores the converted photos in the iPod Photo Cache folder before transferring them to the iPod. This basically allows iTunes to quickly add/remove photos from your iPod without having to reconvert them every time. If you remove a photo album/folder from your iPod (by unchecking the box in iTunes preferences), it will still leave the pictures in the cache in case you want to add them again in the future.

Possible workaround:

Move the iPod Photo Cache folder to the location of your choice, and make an alias (shortcut) to the folder in its new location. Place the alias in the folder where the iPod Photo Cache originally was (usually in the Pictures folder) and make sure the alias is named ""iPod Photo Cache"". When iTunes looks for the iPod Photo Cache folder in the Pictures folder, it will instead find the alias, directing it to the new location. 

You didn't specify the OS of the computer but on Windows that would be a junction point.

A: You need a second step to hide it from Live Mesh and also to make sure it doesn't show up in your Pictures view of Windows 7, etc.


*

*Sync your photos, allowing iTunes to create the folder in your Pictures folder as usual

*Copy that folder to a location out of the way, I like to use where iTunes keeps the rest of their data (and should put the photo cache IMHO):


C:\Users\User Name\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media
NOTE: You can put it on a share or other drive if you wish, as long as you use a soft link (which we do below)
3.Create the symbolic link. I use MKLINK from the Windows SDK.
Open the CMD window as Administrator and type:
cd C:\Users\User Name\Pictures
MKLINK /D ""iPod Photo Cache"" ""C:\Users\User Name\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\iPod Photo Cache""
Then, you will see the folder appear in your Pictures folder with the familiar ""Shortcut"" arrow.
4.Right-mouse-click that folder and select ""Hide Folder""
When it asks if you want to hide it just for that folder or all folder and files pick only for this folder

Any ideas? Thanks!

A: That particular line (You have mail) isn't actually part of bash's startup but an alert that your local account on your computer has received mail for some reason.
You can use mail to read and delete the message or just delete the message (most likely a bounce back or something from development) from /var/mail/username

A: This notification is configured by environment variable MAILCHECK. See man bash and search for MAILCHECK (press / and type MAILCHECK to search in the man page).
Here's the relevant excerpt:

 MAILCHECK
              Specifies how often (in seconds)  bash  checks  for  mail.   The
              default  is  60 seconds.  When it is time to check for mail, the
              shell does so before displaying the  primary  prompt.   If  this
              variable  is  unset,  or  set  to  a  value that is not a number
              greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking.

To verify that this variable is indeed set, run echo $MAILCHECK
To disable this notification, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc

unset MAILCHECK


A: This probably doesn't answer the mail question but here is some more info on the startup files.
Are you searching for the files in Finder?  Make sure that you are searching from a terminal and using ls -A so that hidden files (files beginning with a '.') show up.
The following is from the Bash Reference Guide.  It describes the startup files that are executed when you start a new terminal window in OS X (which is an interactive, login shell).
6.2 Bash Startup Files
This section describes how Bash executes its startup files. If any of the files exist but cannot be read, Bash reports an error. Tildes are expanded in file names as described above under Tilde Expansion (see Section 3.5.2 [Tilde Expansion], page 19).
Interactive shells are described in Section 6.3 [Interactive Shells], page 75.
Invoked as an interactive login shell, or with ‘--login’
When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.
When a login shell exits, Bash reads and executes commands from the file ‘~/.bash_logout’, if it exists."|"Q: Where are bash profile startup files? I know that you can have a .profile or .bashrc file in your home folder to customise Mac OS X 10.6.4 Terminal bash startup.

Can it be done?

A: Sure. You need to convert the pages of the PDF into images and handle accordingly from there, much like a photo slide"|"show. The primary concern I would have is whether the PDF is laid out so that it looks good on screen.
Acrobat (the full version, not Reader) can export all pages to a variety of formats. Acrobat costs good money, but Preview only exports the first page. Ghostscript via Terminal might have a free alternative, but the interface is the command line.

A: I would use PDF to Keynote, and then just export from Keynote as a QuickTime movie.

A: I know this is dated link, but for what is worth...
DVD Studio Pro allows you to create a Data DVD alongside the video DVD.
Check your DVDSP Inspector for DVD Assets. This is a great way to include files and images, even presentations that you wish clients to open and view.
There is also DVD@ccess which allows you to embed URLs into buttons that will cause the DVD player to stop (on a computer) and launch your browser.

441||"Q: How do you find the UDID for an iOS device? How do you find the UDID for an iOS device on Mac and Windows?

A: An alternative for those who don't actually run iTunes (yes there are alternatives) is to open the System Profiler, access the USB section, find the iPhone on the list of connected devices under the USB device tree.
On the iPhone listing there will be an entry that says serial number. This is not to be confused with the serial number listed in the General -> About section of the iPhone settings. The serial in the System Profiler is equivalent to the UDID.

Note that on Lion, System Profiler has been"|"renamed System Information and you can get the the USB information from the hardware portion of the System Report.

A: This approach requires only a macOS device, the iOS device and the device's power cord.
If you have the iOS paired to the macOS device through wi-fi, you don't need a power cord and can skip steps 1 and 2.
This approach was based on macOS Catalina v10.15.5 and may not apply for other versions of the OS.
Steps

*

*Connect the iOS device to an USB port of your macOS device.

*If the iOS device asks for permission to trust the macOS device, grant it (assuming it's a device you trust).

*Open the Finder app.

*Go to the iOS device in the Locations section of the sidebar. It should open the device's page.

*Click on the info section bellow the iOS device name on the top of the page until it displays the UDID.


You can copy the UDID by right clicking on it.
Source

A: You can follow the official how-to from Apple KB.
The same way works for iPhone, iPod and iPad.
The easiest way is to plug your iDevice, open iTunes, click on your device on the left panel of iTunes then click on the serial number. Your UDID will appear :


A: While all the methods described so far require the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad to be connected to a computer, there are a large number of free applications available in the App Store to find the UDID without needing to do this (and, thus, effectively working on Mac, Windows, and indeed anything else).
The one I use and generally recommend to remote clients is Erica Sadun's Ad Hoc Helper (screenshot, etc., at below link):
http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ad-hoc-helper/id285691333?mt=8

A: ePub is the newer standard and is supported by the Apple iBooks app, but Apple only supports it's own FairPlay DRM wrapper used to encrypt the ePub files to protect the books from being copied or read on unauthorised devices. 
Most other (non-Apple) eBook stores sell ePub books encrypted with Adobe's Adept DRM wrapper, which you can't read with the iBooks app (although certain other eBook apps do support the Adobe DRM system)

444||"Q: How do I create a custom ringtone for my iPhone? The iPhone has a very limited selection of default ringtones.
How do I create a new ringtone for my iPhone?

A: Honestly, on windows iRinger  is one of the easiest ways. Choose an audio file select the segment you want, adjust, click ""Export"" and it's in iTunes
Simple and easy

A: This solution requires Mac OS X, but is otherwise free:


*

*Open the audio file you want to make into a ringtone in QuickTime Player. If the file is a song in iTunes, control-click on the file and select ""Show in Finder"", then open QuickTime Player and drag the file from the Finder to the QuickTime Player icon in the dock.

*If the audio file is longer than 40 seconds, you will need to trim it down:


*

*In the menu bar, select Edit -> Trim... and the scrubber will turn into a selector for the desired start and end.

*Move the start and end so the selection is not more than 40 seconds. It's best to err on the side of caution and not go above 39.75 seconds.

*Click ""Trim""


*From the menu bar, select File -> Export... and save as an ""Audio Only"" file on your desktop or other convenient location.

*Download MakeiPhoneRingtone from Rogue Amoeba and launch the app.

*Drag the file exported from QuickTime Player into the MakeiPhoneRingtone window. It will be automatically converted to the appropriate file format to be a ringtone and imported into iTunes.
I have successfully created several ringtones for my iPhone using this method.

A: *

*If the song/sound you want to use isn't already in your iTunes library, add it to your iTunes library first.

*If you want to use just a part of the song/sound, right click it, select ""Get Info"", then ""Options"" tab, and enter a start and stop time there. Remember, ringtones can't be over 40 seconds!

*On the File menu, select ""Convert"" > ""Create AAC Version"". If you don't have this option, go to Edit, Preferences, General tab, and click the Import Settings button."|"Make sure the import setting is set to ""iTunes Plus"" (AAC).

*This will create a new file in your iTunes library. Delete it from your iTunes library now, but be sure to check ""keep file"" in the delete dialog so the file itself isn't removed, just the library entry.

*Navigate to where the file was created on disk, somewhere like music\iTunes\iTunes Music\{artist}\{album}

*Rename the file from .m4a to .m4r

*Drag and drop this .m4r file into the Ringtones folder of your iTunes (or, just double-click it and iTunes will handle it automatically).

*Sync your iPhone. Make sure that ""Sync Ringtones"" is selected in the phone sync options (mine was off by default).
After syncing, you can select your new ringtone in Settings, Sounds at the Custom section at the top.

A: You can create or import a song in the IOS version of Garageband directly on your phone, and then export it as a ringtone which will appear in the ringtone list under Settings. 
Once you have created your song by using any of the virtual instruments or importing an actual song:


*

*Go to My Songs (the top left icon), and long-press on the song your created.

*A Share menu will appear which contains among other options an item named Ringtone.

*Enter the ringtone name and save it.

*Go to Settings > Sounds and assign your new ringtone.


No need to pay anything, you don't need a Mac or iTunes, and you are only using free Apple software.
There is a more detailed tutorial here.

A: iPhone ringtones are just AAC songs, no longer than 40 seconds, with an M4R extension, instead of the usual M4A that iTunes uses.
You can make the ringtones using iTunes itself. Just make a copy of the song and set the start and end position so that the song doesn't run longer than 40 seconds.
There are some apps that do that for you. I have use Ringer and Ringtones, on the Mac, and both worked pretty well.

A: One other option that costs $1.99 in the App Store -- iRingtones
I use it and like it. Although I wish I knew about the GarageBand method before. :-)

A: The easiest solution is to get Fission.app and use it to crop the tracks (as ringtones can only be up to 40 seconds long) and export it in .m4r ringtone format.
Fission.app is not free, but there’s a trial version.

That said, if you’re looking for a solution that doesn’t require third-party software, see your own answer.

A: I haven't used it recently, but in the past I've had good results with this website: http://audiko.net/
Assuming it still works with the iPhone 4, it's rather an easier process: you just upload your MP3, trim it to your liking using the flash interface, download the ringtone file, and drag it into iTunes.  Good luck!

A: Alternatively, if you're using a Mac, you could just fire up Garageband. Here's a quick tutorial on Lifehacker:
http://lifehacker.com/334073/create-custom-iphone-ringtones-the-free-and-apple-way

A: For those of you with jailbroken iOS devices, there are at least three paid Cydia apps that can do both the ringtone conversion and adding (the adding part is not allowed for App store apps) directly on the device: AnyRing, Bridge and AudioExplorer+. (Disclosure: I am the developer of AudioExplorer+). You would of course still need to transfer the audio file to the device, but jailbroken devices also offer more ways to do this (like scp for example).

A: I always use Ringer.org to make free ringtones for my iPhone. It's completely free and easy.

A: We can make our own custom ringtones using garageband that you might already know. But it can only access the music that are non Apple music. When you create a ringtone .m4r on a computer and then sending into music app via the iTunes, the sound quality reduces. So the best solution is to use garageband. But the song should be in your music library before you can do that. And to add music into your library of your iPhone through iTunes you need to turn off iCloud music library that deletes all the Apple music in your device. So here is the solution 


*

*Connect your iPhone to pc/macbook.

*Open iTunes in it.

*Open the iPhone and go to apps on the side menubar.

*Now go to garageband app and add the song that you want.

*After adding the song disconnect the iPhone.

*Now the song is available in your garageband library.


It is the best way to make a custom ringtone. 

A: I like this way to do it because it is simple and once you have the script installed you can do it all in itunes without having to navigate anywhere else.
I use Doug's apple scripts "" make ringable "" script. 
make ringable script page 
You download the script, put it in the script folder. he has instruction on how to do this and use his scripts on his web site.   Before you use the script, in itunes select the song you want to use and use command I to open up the metadata info box for it. adjust the start and stop point for the section you want to use ( 40 seconds or shorter ) and close the info box. 
To make a ringtone out of the song you just manipulated you single click on the song so it highlighted then click on the script menu in the tool bar at the top of iTunes, click on the ""make ringable"" script in the drop down menu. Follow the instructions in the pop up box. It makes a ringtone of the song you selected and places it in the tones library. You can then go back and set the song time parameters back to where they were. When you sync your iphone choose to sync tones and voilà you have your new ringtone(s) on your phone. 

If you like it and use it, Donate to Doug on his web page for the time and effort he put into writing the script. I did.


A: I've used this method before, and I find it very reliable.

I use FW800 out of the MacBook Pro into one unit, and then the pass-thru connector from that unit to the next one (each unit has a pass-thru connector; these boxes really were a steal at the price).
I use one unit as my main 'projects and laptop backups' drive, and the second unit is my backup copy of the first one. I've been managing the backup copies using SuperDuper!, manually initiating a 'smartcopy' of the main drive to the backup drive at least once a week.
The disks I had in one of the units recently failed, and now I've bought 4"|"identical new 1TB Seagate disks. Before I set things up much as they were before (2TB in each unit), I was wondering if I could make a software RAID 1 unit out of them? I thought that this would be an easier system for me to manage than manually backing-up.
Has anyone run a software RAID 1 drive on external drives like this? Is it worth the trouble, or should I stick to my current regime? I'm not looking to increase performance at all, I'm looking to minimise the human-involvement in my backup process. :-)
This would be on the current patch of Snow Leopard.

A: A RAID setup is not a backup. A RAID is a way of mitigating hardware failure, its value is that despite a piece of hardware failing you can keep working with no down time. In your case, the issue you had a (a failed drive) would have been handled just fine by a RAID, but the following would not:


*

*Accidentally deleting a file (the RAID will happily delete it on both of the mirrored drives.

*Data corruption due to bugs in any programs you are using (again, the RAID will dutifully store the bad data the apps send to it).


The above are software and user failures. If you are confident you (or an app) will never make a mistake where you need to rollback to an older version then you simply don't need a backup, and going to a RAID to mitigate potential HW failure is fine. If you are like the rest of us an make mistakes then you probably want actual backups, and to add a RAID in addition to that if down time is very costly for you.

A: I haven't tried FW800 specifically but we use a lot of OSX-RAID1 on internal drives and i used it once on FW400.
You just have to create a mirrored disk set from the external disks in DiskUtility. You should use the whole disks and let DiskUtility do the partitioning. That makes it easier to rebuild and boot off the set.
You can also start out with data already on one disk, then create a degraded set on a second disk, copy everything over and integrate the first disk into the set but this requires some non-supported use of command-line diskutil. The same goes for creating partitions on the RAID set or creating a RAID out of partitions. (All of which is perfectly normal and handy on e.g. Linux)"|"new 1TB disks to replace them. I'd like to set up the new disks as a RAID 1 mirror of the existing drive. I've never done any of this before, and I'm not sure where to start. I've read that RAID 1 is a good option for personal backups, but I'm not sure how to get it set up.
I've also read that the new disks should be 'JBOD' units, and that the enclosures are just pass-thru connectors, so I'm not sure if I need to configure the enclosures or just the disks themselves.
I've also read that the enclosures may have their own RAID configurations, and that I should check the documentation for the enclosures before doing anything.

(would have posted a picture here to show what I mean, but I am apparently not allowed to)

This is"|"really annoying me lol, almost to the point of me considering just deleting the albums only to get rid of this...   hoping someone has an alternative suggestion ;-)

A: It's possible the ""Part of a compilation"" meta data wasn't set for these tracks. You can group them together as a single ""album"" in iTunes by:


*

*Selecting all the tracks you want to come from the same album (use Cmd-Left Click to select multiple, non-contiguous tracks) 

*Hitting ⌘-I to bring up the meta-data editor window and then: 


*

*For the Album Arist field enter: Various Arists

*For the Album field enter the name of the compilation album

*And then make sure the Part of a compilation option box is checked


*Click OK to apply the changes to all the tracks


You should now see them grouped together in the grid view as one album, all showing (hopefully) the same cover art. If they're not showing the same cover art:


*

*Find the cover art you like.

*Copy it to the clipboard with ⌘-C

*select all the tracks again and open the meta-data editor window.

*Click once in the Artwork window and hit ⌘-V to paste the cover art to all the tracks.

*Click OK to add the cover art to every track in the compilation.


A: The reason why there are so many covers is that each song comes from a separate album hence the 100s of album covers.
The fix would be to remove each song's cover art (I believe it has to be done for each song manually) and then applying a new image in bulk for all songs. To do so, select all songs, then (command-i or Ctrl-i on windows) and then drop the artwork onto the big white square on the right of the dialog that just popped."|"on Apple Music, and I'm talking about compilation albums.

If you try to untick ""Sync Applications"" on the Apps tab iTunes says ""Are you sure you do"|"not want to sync applications? All existing applications and their data on the iPhone will be removed.""
However if I don't tick sync apps (bearing in mind my laptop is new) my computer tries to remove all the apps, because it doesn't ""own"" any applications.
Is there any way I can sync without deleting all my apps?

A: It is really annoying, isn't it.
One thing that works reasonably well is for you to right click on your device in iTunes after connecting it (but before syncing it) and select ""Transfer my purchases"". That will copy your apps to the local copy of iTunes, so if it syncs it won't wipe things out. Not for apps at least. Music and video is a whole other headache.

A: The easiest way to do this is to copy your old iTunes folder (usually located in Music/iTunes or My Music/iTunes) - depending on which version of which operating system you are sing and replace your new iTunes folder which will be in the same location on your new laptop with the older one. 
That usually solves my problems."|"want to stop syncing applications on this iPhone? All of your

So, does anyone know how to make OS X to update Dashboard widgets immediately or maybe somehow prefetch the data once every 15 min or so? Or does anyone else see this problem at all?

A: The solution comes from a System Preference pane called Dashboard Kickstart.

This application runs in the background and reacts to the starting or re-starting of the Dock. When that happens it initiates the starting of the Dashboard. This prevents the delay you'll experience when launching Dashboard the first time you want to use it."|"show the widgets.

A: It sounds as though your iPhone and/or iTunes aren’t synced to each other. Unfortunately, for you to manage the apps on the iPhone from iTunes, the iPhone needs to be synced to iTunes. So you’ll have to go through this procedure at least once, and replace what’s on the iPhone w/ what’s in iTunes.
No way around that, but thankfully, any apps you’ve purchased are free to you to download again, so if there are any that are missing in iTunes, just download them again.
But yes, if any of the apps aren’t in iTunes, and you’ve got data stored in those apps, that data will be lost.

A: Your Mac can ask your password after it wakes up if you set it to do so in the Preferences panel (Security). From there on, you can use ⌥+⌘+⏏ to put your Mac to sleep. So all you have to do is hit that and walk away.

A: If you enable screen locking within the screen saver pref pane you can put the computer to sleep and lock at the same time by pressing ⌘+⌥+F12

A: ⇧+⌘+⌥+Q will perform a ""quick logout.""
Another option is to enable a password when waking from sleep or screen saver and adding a hot corner for one or the other. Then locking is as simple as tossing a mouse in a corner.

A: To lock your screen using a apple keyboard try this 
Or do this by going to ""System Preferences"" then ""Security"" under ""General""

A: If you want to be able to remote control your Mac (with Synergy or something similar) even when it's locked, I'd recommend you to show the Keychain Status in the Menu Bar. You do that as follows:

A: Here is a good tutorial which will help you to create a short cut keys to lock your mac machine
http://www.macyourself.com/2013/01/27/how-to-lock-your-mac-screen-with-a-keyboard-shortcut/
Lock Screen Service
1. Launch Automator from your Applications folder.
2. Select Service as the document type.
3. Select Utilities from the list on the left, then double-click Run Shell Script in the next column.

4. On the top-right side of the screen, adjust the drop-down menus so the statement reads: Service receives [no input] in [any application]
5. Copy the following command into the large text box that appears:
/System/Library/CoreServices/""Menu Extras""/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend

6. Go to File > Save and name your service Lock Screen. Once saved, you can now quit Automator.
Lock Screen Keyboard Shortcut
1. Launch System Preferences and go to the Keyboard pane.
2. Next, select the Keyboard Shortcuts tab. From the list on the"|"left, select Application Shortcuts. Click on the plus (+) button below to add your new shortcut.
3. In the dialog box we’ll want to leave All Applications selected in the first menu. Enter Lock Screen as the Menu Title. Please note this has to be exactly the same name you entered when saving the service in Automator. Finally, enter your keyboard shortcut. Let’s go with Command+Option+Shift+L.

4. Click Add and you’re all done!
Now when you press your keyboard shortcut (Command+Option+Shift+L), the Mac login screen will immediately be displayed. You’re still technically logged in and processes such as large downloads will continue in the background. But you can leave your Mac unattended without worry – no one will be able to access your account until you enter your password. When you do, everything on your desktop will be there just as you left it!

A: 
Go to settings -> Mission control and then over to HotCorners on the bottom left corner.

There are 4 corner setting appearing there. Choose anyone of them according to your feasibility as put to sleep. Just by dragging the mouse to that corner will put it to sleep and lock your system. I guess thats the best easy shortcut i have discovered.

A: If you're using Alfred, just invoke Alfred and start typing ""lock"". I don't remember if it's activated by default, but if not, you can activate and change the keywords in the Alfred preferences.


A: Via the Expose system preferences panel you can set a ""hot corner"" of your monitor that activates your screen saver. Say you set the Bottom Left corner, as soon as you move your mouse there the screen saver will invoke. If you've set a password on it, bingo, done.
Yet another option is to enable Fast User Switching in the Login Options pane of the Accounts preferences panel. This puts a Users menu in the top right hand corner, from which you can quickly choose ""Login Window..."". This kicks you to the login screen, requiring a password to move away from, and also does not end your session/quit any running apps.

A: Deskshade does exactly what you are asking. It locks the screen displaying only a huge padlock sign so intruders know the screen is locked which prevents unnecessary attempts to use the machine whiles you are away. 
http://macrabbit.com/

A: SizzlingKeys is a little Preference Pane that mostly lets you configure iTunes keyboard shortcuts, but one of the ""Extras"" included lets you specify a shortcut to actually lock the computer and take you to the Fast User Switching screen, not just start the screensaver. I keep Lock configured as ⌃+⌘+L but you can specify whatever you want.
SizzlingKeys has a paid upgrade, but the Lock shortcut is configurable using the free version.

A: Another program that can allow you to quickly lock your screen is Padlock. Note that the aforelinked  Macworld review of Padlock also gives a comprehensive review of other solutions (many of which were discussed above) for locking your Mac.

A: FTW!  A keyboard short cut to launch screen saver which you can configure with a password lock.  All free.  Follow the link for better explanation and screens.  I have been using quicksilver to launch the screensaver which works nicely as well.
http://leafraker.com/2007/09/14/start-the-screen-saver-with-quicksilver/

The only thing left to do is to define a keyboard trigger. I’m using
  “Shift/Control/Command-L” as my trigger.
This key combination may sound a bit awkward at first, but I’m using
  “Shift/Control/Command” for all my Quicksilver trigger. The nice thing
  about this combination is that it rarely cause conflicts with other
  keyboard shortcuts, and once you are used to this combination it’s
  really not this bad. So in this case I combined it with the letter
  “L”, for “Lock”.


A: There is finally a native way to lock your screen, starting with macOS High Sierra (10.13).
This can be done by clicking the Apple menu at the top left of the screen, and then pressing ""Lock Screen."" The shortcut associated with this action is ^⌘Q. Arguably, this is not as convenient as the ❖L (Windows + L) shortcut that exists on Windows.
However, one can achieve a similar behavior on the Mac natively. Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts, click on All Applications, press the + (plus) button at the bottom, type in ""Lock Screen"" (without quotes) for the menu title, and for the shortcut assign your own shortcut (such as ⌘L). Now you can use ⌘L à la Windows (or your own shortcut) to lock the screen.
Note that using ⌘L as your lock screen shortcut will render it ineffective for other tasks such as focusing on the URL bar in Safari.

A: Logging out to the fast user switching screen


*

*Run /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend.

*Enable the fast user switching menu from the Users & Groups preference pane and then select Login Window… from the menu.

*Use the lock action in Alfred.


Locking the screen


*

*Check ""Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins"" in the Security & Privacy preference pane. You can then lock the computer manually by pressing control-shift-eject to turn off displays or option-command-eject to go to sleep. A power key can be substituted for eject in 10.8 and later. In 10.9 and later, you can also put displays to sleep by running pmset displaysleepnow.

*Enable the Keychain menu extra from the preferences of Keychain Access and then select Lock Screen... from the menu.

A: Use a keyboard shortcut and use Automator to make a screen lock service. This will allow you to set any keyboard command you would like to lock or start a screen saver on your mac. As referenced below is a nice article on how to do the process.
Handy screen locking tips for Mac

If mousing to part of the screen isn’t your thing, you can use the keyboard to lock the screen, but it takes Automator (or a third-party application, but Automator is the better bet if you’re using OS X 10.6). Launch Automator and create a new service.
Tell the new service that it receives “no input” (rather than the default of “text”). The default is also for “any application”, make sure to keep this set. Next, drag the Start Screen Saver action from the Utilities action group to the workflow. Finally, save the service and give it a name, such as Start Screensaver. Go back to Keyboard Shortcuts in the Keyboard section of System Preferences and look in the Services group. Scroll down to the General section and you will see the newly created Start Screensaver service is enabled. Click in the whitespace to the far right of this entry and a new entry box will appear. Type the keyboard shortcut, such as CTRL-OPT-L.
Exit System Preferences.

You will now be able to hit CTRL-OPT-L and activate the screen saver in order to lock the screen. If you wish to return to the login window instead (you are still logged in, but the computer is locked) rather than activate the screensaver, change the Automator service to Run Shell Script instead of Start Screen Saver and have it run the following command:
/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/user.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend

460||"Q: Sync iTunes U between 2 Macs via an iPod Is it possible to download lectures (from iTunes U) with iTunes on Mac A, sync an iPod to Mac A, then carry that iPod to Mac B, and finally watch them on Mac B?
That's what I have been doing with my previous iPod (not an iPod Touch) because it allows me to use it as a USB hard drive. Now that I'm using an iPod Touch (which doesn't allow me to see what's inside), I wonder if I can use syncing to do the same job.

A: Actually, there is a way you can sync your device to more than one iTunes library in different computers. The trick is making the device believe that it is the same library.
Each library has an associated identifier."|"By modifying one of the libraries and putting the id of the other, you will accomplish that.
In order to do so, select one of the computers, the one that you are currently syncing with, and find out its identifier. Look for a file called iTunes Music Library.xml. In a Mac, this file is in the ~/Music/iTunes directory (though I think it can vary depending on what version of iTunes it was created with). In a PC, I guess it must be somewhere under the My Documents folder.
Open it with a text editor and find out a line which reads like
<key>Library Persistent ID</key><string>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</string>

where the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX will be the identifier for that library.
Now, on the second computer, find out the same file, and, after making a backup (just in case), and making sure iTunes is not running, copy the identifier to a new document, because we'll need it shortly, and then replace it with the identifier from the first computer. Now, we're halfway done. The following step is the difficult one.
With a hex editor (which is an editor that allows editing the bytes of a binary file; my PC using mates recommend Ultraedit, while I on the Mac like HexFiend), open a file called iTunes Library in the same directory (remember, make a backup first), and do a search for the same string (or rather, byte string) that you copied and replace it with the new one from the first computer.
After performing these steps, you should be able to sync both computers with the same device without problems.

A: It won't let you sync, but you should be able to connect the iPod touch to Mac B and still see the iPod under devices in iTunes.  If you hit the expansion triangle (twistie?  whatever it's called) it should show you the playlists on that iPod and let you play them through iTunes.

A: Syncing an iPod/iPhone to iTunes is a one-to-one relationship between the two. Syncing on iPod with an iTunes install essentially ties it to that iTunes. Syncing later to a different iTunes install invariably results in the ""delete all data"" dialog."|"The trick is making the device believe that it is the same library. Each library has an associated identifier. In your case, you can get the identifier of the library on Mac A by running the following command in terminal:

/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/Resources/itunes_store_information.plist

This will open the file in your terminal and give you the identifier. Then, you need to copy that identifier to your iPod and make it believe that the library on the iPod is the same as the one on Mac A.

A: I'm not sure what you're asking, but I can help with syncing an iPod with more than one computer.
First, you need to make sure the iPod is connected to the computer. Then, you need to open the ""iTunes"" application on the computer. Once the iPod is connected, you should see it in the left-hand sidebar of the iTunes window.
Next, you need to select the iPod in the sidebar. Then, click the ""Sync"" button at the bottom of the window. iTunes will copy the songs, videos, and other content from your computer's iTunes library to the iPod.
If you want to sync the iPod with a different computer, you'll need to do the following:
1. Connect the iPod to the new computer.
2. Open the ""iTunes"" application on the new computer.
3. Click the ""Sync"" button at the bottom of the window. iTunes will copy the songs, videos, and other content from the computer's iTunes library to the iPod.

A: As mankoff said, the large size is probably a resource fork (with things like previews).  To confirm this, use the Terminal command ls -l@ /Volumes/Database/WebFolder/imgs/confirm.gif -- you'll probably see something like this:

        com.apple.ResourceFork  40748 

If it doesn't show a 40kb resource fork, report back so we'll all have a better idea what's going on.
As long as the image is just for web use, a big resource fork isn't really an issue, since the web server will only serve the data fork (which is just 539 bytes long).  If want to compact the file anyway, use the command xattr -d com.apple.ResourceFork /Volumes/Database/WebFolder/imgs/confirm.gif to remove the fork.

A: The Finder preview data isn't stored inside the actual file, so that's not what's causing your size problems.
ImageOptim is a handy GUI tool for shrinking excess data. Also, if you're making a small image I'd recommend png or gif, jpeg is designed for photos.

How do I disable this startup sound?

A: Open Terminal.app and type:

sudo -s

Give the password when asked for
then:
cat >/private/etc/rc.shutdown.local
#! /bin/sh /usr/bin/osascript -e 'set volume with output muted'

then press Ctrl-D and type ""exit"".
Next time you'll reboot in silence BUT you'll have to manually reset the sound volume (F10, slider ...) if you want to hear some music again. Theoretically it should be possible to run under /private/etc/rc.local a script to do it ('set volume without output muted') but that seems to behave erratically.

A: I haven't noticed that sound on my MacBook Pro for ages, and today I figured out why. The MBP seems to remember 2 sets of volume settings; both for having-no-headphones-plugged-in, and for having-headphones-plugged-in. 
I"|"usually have my external speakers plugged in-when I'm at home, and when I'm travelling/way from home obviously I don't. At some point in the past I have turned the volume down to zero when headphones weren't connected, and now when I start the MBP up there's no sound.
You could try this (though it's not particularly practical) - turn the volume on your Mac right down to zero, then restart the computer. I suspect you won't hear the startup-sound. Like I say, not really practical but if the start-up noise annoys you enough, you might just get into the habit of turning the volume down before switching off. :-)
EDIT: Just realised this this point about turning the volume down has already been made in other answers here, so feel free to ignore this! 

A: For Snow Leopard and earlier machines download and install ""StartupSound.prefPane"" which will install a preference pane in system settings to allow you to adjust the startup volume and disable the startup sound:
http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~arcana/StartupSound/BETA/index.en.html
Note that the above has mixed results in Lion.  For Lion users the following is recommended:

  
*
  
*Login as administrator and open a terminal window
  
*Create scriptfile for muting
sudo nano /path/to/mute-on.sh
  
*Enter this as content, when done press control+O to save and control+X to exit:
#!/bin/bash
osascript -e 'set volume with output muted'
  
*Create scriptfile for unmuting
sudo nano /path/to/mute-off.sh
  
*Enter this as content, when done press control+O to save and control+X to exit:
#!/bin/bash
osascript -e 'set volume without output muted'
  
*Make both files executable:
sudo chmod u+x /path/to/mute-on.sh
sudo chmod u+x /path/to/mute-off.sh
  
*Check if any hooks already exist (these will be overwritten, so make sure it is OK for you)
sudo defaults read com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook
sudo defaults read com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook
  
*Add hooks for muting
sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook /path/to/mute-on.sh
sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /path/to/mute-off.sh
Notes:
  
  
*
  
*/path/to/ is the location of the scripts, I used /Library/Scripts/
  
*you can skip the unmuting loginhook (i.e. each logout will silence your machine), but I like it this way because I always have sound
  available exactly at the volume level I set last time
  
*root has to be the owner of the script files - running an editor from command line with sudo is the easiest way to achieve that
  (otherwise you need to chown)
  
*to delete the hooks, use the following:
sudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook
sudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook

Ex: The parent of /var is /, so private/var is correct, relative to /. Per my above example of bin -> Applications, both are in my Home Directory, no matter where I run it, the output is the same.

A: GNU coreutils-8.15 added in 2012 a new command-line tool realpath that does what you want: it resolves chains of symbolic links and outputs the result as either an absolute (default) or relative path.
Apple does not yet include realpath in macOS (they sadly seem to shun all GPLv3 tools), but you can easily install it yourself, e.g. using Homebrew: brew install coreutils.

A: In zsh:
echo /usr/local/bin/python3(:A)

Or more robustly, in case there are backslashes in the path:
print -lr -- /usr/local/bin/python3(:A)

This prints the absolute path to the file with all symbolic links resolved (i.e. it's equivalent to GNU readlink -f, not to a plain readlink).
Explanation: the parentheses (…) at the end of a word surround a list of glob qualifiers. A colon : in the list of glob qualifiers starts a list of history modifiers. The history modifier A turns the given path into an absolute path and resolves all symbolic links.
If this is the python3 in your $PATH, you can save typing with equals expansion.
echo =python3(:A)

Even if you aren't running zsh, you can invoke it just for that.
zsh -c 'echo /usr/local/bin/python3(:A)

or (putting the history modifier directly on the parameter expansion)
zsh -c 'echo $0:A' /usr/local/bin/python3


pwd -P can work as well, but only for a (symlink to a) directory. pwd only prints information about the current directory. It doesn't take an argument. So it's useless for a regular file, and for a directory you need to change into it first.
(cd some/where && pwd -P)

With find, I don't even know what you're trying to do.

A: This resolves recursively and returns an absolute path:
$ python
>>> import os
>>> os.path.realpath(""/usr/local/bin/python3"")

Or the non-interactive version:
python -c ""import os; print(os.path.realpath('/usr/local/bin/python3'))""


A: Maybe this discussion on Stack Overflow is of help: How to resolve symbolic links in a shell script
In particular, please consider this answer.

A: There are other answers using a python one-liner, or suggesting to install GNU programs using homebrew so you can have access to readlink -f or realpath. A recent update to macOS (12.3) has apparently introduced readlink -f natively as well.
Developing a solution in Bash to do the job across more platforms is a tricky problem, but the following canonpath function correctly handles the edge cases that cause some simpler solutions to fail:
canonpath() (
    # Print absolute canonical path, like GNU's `readlink -f`
    # - target may be symlink, file or directory; path may contain ., .., symlinks
    tgt=${1:?Non-null path required for canonpath}
    [[ -e $tgt ]] || { echo >&2 ""target path must exist""; return 2; }

    # resolve symlink(s) at basename (possible chain)
    while [[ -L $tgt ]]; do
        tgt_dir=$(dirname -- ""$tgt"")
        tgt=$(readlink ""$tgt"")

        # handle relative symlink and tgt_dir=/
        [[ ${tgt:0:1} == / ]] || tgt=${tgt_dir%/}/$tgt
    done

    _canon_dir() ( builtin cd -P ""$1"" &>/dev/null && pwd; )

    if [[ -d $tgt ]]; then
        # handle paths like this/is/a/link/..
        printf '%s\n' ""$(_canon_dir ""$tgt"")""

    elif [[ -f $tgt ]]; then
        printf '%s/%s\n' ""$(_canon_dir ""$(dirname -- ""$tgt"")"")"" ""$(basename -- ""$tgt"")""

    else
        echo >&2 ""unknown file type""
        return 3
    fi
)

Testing examples:
# use `set -vx` if you want to see the gory details of unwinding the paths
# can also compare against `greadlink -f` if you have installed it with homebrew

canonpath /var
# outputs /private/var on macOS

ln -s ~/Documents /tmp/alink
canonpath /tmp/alink/..
# outputs HOME path as expected

ln -s /etc /tmp/e
mkdir /tmp/a && cd /tmp/a
ln -s ../e b
cd ..
canonpath a/b
# outputs /private/etc on macOS

touch /tmp/f
cd /tmp/a
ln -s ../f
cd ..
canonpath a/f
# outputs /private/tmp/f on macOS
# rm e f a/b a/f && rmdir a

Handling paths that don't exist
There is a small difference in functionality between the canonpath function above and GNU's readlink -f, in that canonpath explicitly requires that the path must exist. readlink -f allows the final path element to be a broken symlink, or simply non-existent. The function could be adapted to accommodate this functionality, but I suggest simply testing for path existence before calling canonpath, and passing the parent directory of a non-existent path if necessary.

A: You may use readlink -f. It recurses through all the links. Suppose the link is to a path that is further a link. You would like to have the final absolute path."|"Q: How to get the fully resolved path of a symbolic link in Terminal? I have a tangled mess of python installations on my laptop.

468||"Q: Can I set the stereo Bluetooth profile as the default, or remove the mono profile?  Whenever I turn on my Nokia bluetooth headphones they automatically connect to my Macbook. The problem is they always connect to the Mono (and not the Stereo) profile. So I have to disconnect and reconnect with the stereo profile. Is there anyway to either delete the mono profile or set the stereo profile as the default?
Mac OS X 10.6 Nokia BH-905

A: Since no-one has stepped up with an answer, I'm going to add a few things that may help get you (or someone else) closer to an answer.
In a nutshell, your question is about HSP - the mono headset profile and A2DP - the stereo profile.
HSP was designed for two way, low latency (delay)"|"audio - designed for the limited spectrum telephone lines send for human voice frequencies. It sacrifices sound quality needed to make stereo music sound good.
A2DP is all about better quality and allowing different encoding schemes to get the best music over a bluetooth link (with potential interference) and sacrifices two way audio, microphone, and adds delay to queue up enough music to allow playing over momentary interference or pauses in bluetooth.
Your headset speaks both - so if you could get your headset to only advertise A2DP, the mac would be forced into stereo. I don't think it's possible, but you might see if Nokia allows you to control this.
Even if you were willing to give up HSP completely on the mac, I don't know if you can delete the driver files and re-program the bluetooth board to not negotiate HSP with your headset.
I do know you can use the Bluetooth Explorer (part of Xcode 3) to systematically clear the preferences and play around with things to see if you can really remove all records of the mono pairing. Whether you could edit the profile to delete HSP from the pairing record is hard to know unless you wanted to experiment and learn in depth how this was engineered.

Some things that will help you track the settings are in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist and /Library/Preferences/Audio as well as using the option key while pressing the mouse on the bluetooth menu to expose the 
bluetooth link address of each device so you can match the plist files to actual devices. (Or get the developer tools and use Bluetooth Explorer)
Lastly, you might run the Bluetooth diagnostic utility to see if interference with other devices might be causing your mac to systematically choose HSP which is more nimble than A2DP.
Good luck - I don't have a device with both A2DP and HSP to test, but I can tell you that my A2DP device is by far the worst when it comes to the % of time it fails to connect. (Which is the point where you choose whether to connect as mono or stereo) I usually need three connect attempts to get it working and I'm in a very low noise environment. It works really well once paired - just hard to connect."|"communication, and is used for headsets and headphones. A2DP was designed for one way communication, and is used for speakers and headphones. 

HSP and A2DP are both Bluetooth profiles, and are used for sending audio from a source device (phone, computer, etc) to a headset or headphones. 
HSP is the older profile, and is monaural (single speaker). A2DP is the newer profile, and is stereo. 
HSP is the default profile for many devices, and A2DP must be manually selected. 
HSP is designed for low latency, and A2DP is not.

Which account do I need to use to create the file so that it works for all users?
Do I need to use the sudo command?
Do I need to"|"change the file permissions (e.g. use chmod)?
Is there an easy way to take an existing file and change its ownership instead of having to recreate the file?
Could someone please explain why this error happens?

A: If a plist is owned by root and writable by a user other than root, that's a security issue.
You can change the owner to root with sudo chown root <filename>, and change the permissions with sudo chmod 644 <filename> (4 for read access, 2 for write access, 1 for execute access, added up. The first number is for the owner, the second for the group, the third for everyone.)

A: From the launchctl(1) manpage’s description of the load subcommand:

Note that per-user configuration files (LaunchAgents) must
                be owned by the user loading them. All system-wide daemons (LaunchDaemons) must be owned by
                root. Configuration files must not be group- or world-writable. These restrictions are in
                place for security reasons, as allowing writability to a launchd configuration file allows one
                to specify which executable will be launched.

launchctl has several “Dubious …” messages. The launchd code for 10.6.7 (for example) has three such messages in its launchctl.c (see the function path_goodness_check).


*

*Dubious permissions on file (skipping): <pathname>  

*Dubious ownership on file (skipping): <pathname>  

*Dubious path. Not a regular file or directory (skipping): <pathname>
To avoid these messages a pathname must be (#3) a regular file or directory1 (or a symlink to one) that is (#1) owned by root or the invoking user and (#2) not “group” or “other” writable (i.e. chmod go-w).
1
No named pipes, block/character special device nodes, local domain sockets, etc.

Your file is probably owned by the admin user since you say that you do not get the message when logging in as that user (the pathname is owned by the invoking user in that case).
To make the pathname work for other users, it should be owned by root.
To arrange this, do:
sudo chown root /Library/LaunchAgent/foo.plist


A: Thanks for the answer (changing owner to root) -- that's all I needed.
To make this a bit more than a 'me too' post... I got here via a convoluted path: I was getting ""This API can only be used by a process running within an Aqua session"" errors for a launchdaemon.
Searching for an answer to that led me to Apple's technote on daemons and agents which explained how to resolve the 'Aqua session' error, but that left me with 'dubious ownership' issues. That's how I got here, where my final issue was resolved.
Maybe adding all of that to this discussion will cause some search engine to link this page to one of the precursory issues, thereby saving some future adventurer some time.

A: This is what happens when people do not know how sudo works. To disable services that are on files owned by your user just call launchtl without sudo.

After about 9 months I started seeing occasional precipitous drops in battery level overnight (i.e. from 50% to ""dead"", as in all you see is the red ""charge me"" icon).  This would happen every few weeks, even if I made sure nothing was running in background before going to bed.

Usually I see a 1-2% drop in charge level overnight.
The question: Does the iPhone run its own battery conditioning cycles when it decides it needs to?  If not, what would cause this effect?

*

*The rapid discharge first happened when the phone was 9 months old,

*The phone is now 18 months old,

*The battery behaves normally and holds a charge just fine, and... 

*The rapid discharge happens only every two months or so, over the course of a day or two


A: No, the iPhone does not self-condition. Apple has a guide for conditioning laptop batteries, yet I can't find a version for iOS devices (still looking).
There is a general tips page on maintaining great battery life, as well as general terms about battery replacement.
Personally: This sounds like a bad battery. It sounds like it just plainly is not holding a charge after a certain discharge point. Remember that iOS multitasking is not true multitasking. Barring streaming audio (actually persistent audio in general), there is (almost) NOTHING that your phone can constantly do for more than 20 minutes at a time.
I've streamed audio for hours (hours being... maybe 5?) during the day at ~40% and it did get under 20% by the time I was done, this was both on an iPad, and roughly equivalent on an iPhone 4.

I don't use the keyboard on my iMac because I have an ergonomic keyboard there that I much prefer. What I think would be great is to use that corded ergonomic keyboard as an input to the iphone via a bluetooth"|"device that uses the iMac.
Any thoughts on this?

A: There are apps in App Store: iKeyboard ($9.99), Type2Phone ($9.99), 1Keyboard ($9.99) and Typeeto ($4.99) that allow to use your Mac's keyboard as Bluetooth keyboard. The obvious requirements are Mac with Bluetooth and recent OS X.

A: 2017 Edit: As mentioned in other (newer) answers, there are iPhone apps available that can act as Bluetooth keyboards from the Mac. I've been using Typeeto myself. My original answer should be considered quite out of date now.
I'd recommend using the dedicated Bluetooth keyboard if it's not too much hassle, as it's currently the most elegant solution.
If you really want to type from the iMac though, you'll need a Jailbroken iPhone. There is a VNC server called ""Veency"" available from Cydia. You'll then need a VNC client for the iMac (I use JollysFastVNC myself). The iMac and iPhone also need to be networked via either Wifi or Bluetooth LAN.
You'll want to ignore the video and just look at the iPhone's screen while typing, because it lags heavily.
I would love to have something more elegant to suggest, but other mouse/keyboard-only solutions like Synergy or Teleport are Desktop/Notebook only at the moment.

A: If your iPhone is jailbroken, you can install a BlueTooth driver that supports external keyboards.

A: Try 1Keyboard for Mac
Type on your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV using your Mac's keyboard.
Turn your Mac into a Bluetooth keyboard that works with all of your devices.

A: I've just installed Typeeto today and it seems to work really well. It's easy to pair with multiple devices and then select which one you want to connect."|"Q: Can I use a PC/Mac keyboard as a Bluetooth keyboard for iPhone?

Note : The situation is using a laptop on travel.

A: You can partition the disk and run the OS on one partition and Time machine on the other.
Disk Utility can repartition without losing data. but as usual take a backup first.

A: Lion enables this quite easily (and by default in most cases). It's no where near as good as backing up to another drive since most failures of that drive will render the originals and backups equally inoperable.
Just issue sudo tmutil enablelocal if you think you have the room for this. The normal Time Machine preference pane should show local backups when the main volume isn't connected.
You may need to nominate another drive to be the ""main"" backup and then never connect it again. It's not 100% clear to me yet all the in-s and out-s of this."|"...anyone who has tried this?

Their UI designers likely weighed the number of users who don't want the button vs. the number of users who will be confused because their voicemail button is now missing and decided against the potential confusion. That certainly seems to be how they make most UI decisions.

A: You can disable voicemail button (not remove it) if you jailbreak and install ""voicemailblock"" from Cydia it will disable it. Works with SBSetting so you can enable and disable the button when you want.

A: *5005*86*XXX#

Use this to reset where the button dials
XXX  can be blank (*5005*86*#) and it will throw an error when this is pressed, or you can put another number in there to make a quick dial to someone else such as a phonecard.

A: According to Trezoid answer on superuser the solution is:  
By default the"|"language encoding on VLC (and possibly others) is set to ""default"" which is windows-1252 (possibly only if your language is set to english, but I'm not sure)
This will not display other languages very well. To fix it, open up VLC preferences, click on the Subtitles and OSD tab, and change ""default encoding"" to UTF-8
This will give the program a much wider choice of characters to display from allowing it to render the characters as they should be.

A: I had the same problem and fixed it in this way:
open VLC, preferences, subtitle/OSD, and change default coding to one of Arabic languages.

A: It could be (and looks like) a possible issue regrading encoding. It's probably not UTF-8, and something different.
That being said, if VLC can't play it nothing can. I suggest trying to find different subtitles.

A: Try with MplayerX which features:

  
*
  
*Auto detect the encode method of subtitle file (with Universal Charset Detector)
  
*
  
*Now could support multiple sub files with different encode method
  
*Load subtitles while playing - just drag or double-click it

*

*Would prefer the video to be saved locally to the iPad so we aren't dependent on the video loading from a shared Internet connection.

*Preference is that they click an icon and the video autoloads full screen, would prefer not to have load/select a specific video file and hit play

*Ideally want there to be a custom icon on the desktop for this"|"video : this, I assume may require a safari bookmark saved to the home screen (which requires the video to be hosted...)

*What is required to initialize 10 iPads at once?  Each will need to be synced to iTunes I assume?  Will they then need to be reset to work in the future with each individuals computer/iTunes?

*If the video is stored locally, I was thinking I would use oPlayer or VLC so that the file doesn't have to be synced via iTunes - it can just be stored within the iPad filesystem

A: For reference, the iOS SDK (in case you decide to create a small application that plays the quicktime video), can only read stuff that is:


*

*Inside the Application’s bundle

*the “temp” application’s user’s document directory (not shared between apps)

*Use the APIs to read the user video/audio library. 


Number 1 and 2 would require that you create an iOS app that includes the video as a resource (which will -depending upon the video’s size-, make it a huge app)
Also creating an APP and deploying it, requires an Enterprise Licensing from Apple (so you can deploy to your company iP/ads/ods/hones). So I don’t think thats a good (and cheap) idea.
Using option number three you could go with VLC or something but they would have to pick the video from a library. 
what would I do?
I’d set up a wi-fi network, with a local webserver that hosts the page. Then create a webclip on the iPads. All hardcoded. The WebClip could point to a real webpage, but a DNS “forging” inside your closed network could point it locally while they are there. This way, when they leave, if they take the iPads with them, the link will continue to work when they regain internet, as the DNS will be correct and point to the “external” website. 
If the network is “closed” you can set it up in advance. A good 11n router should handle that.
No syncing, no weird app, no need to tamper each individual’s ipods…
Any catches?"|"Sure, here’s a possible continuation to the above example:

The web app can generate a unique URL for each iPad, which can be used to launch the app. The app can then automatically start playing the video when launched. This approach has the advantage of not requiring local storage, and it’s very easy to set up.

The only downside is that the video will still be dependent on a shared internet connection, but this can be mitigated by using a cloud storage service to host the video. The app can just download the video files on first use, and then stream them from the local device in the future.

This approach also has the advantage of not requiring a custom icon on each iPad, but you can still create a custom icon for the web app.

A: No, there's no official, Apple-approved replacement for the lock screen. If you really want to use Android Lock, you must jailbreak and then install it via Cydia.
Un-jailbroken phones can only do what Apple allows, which is to run one app at a time. Android Lock is different because what it does is to modify the basic system of the phone, which Apple doesn't allow. And that is the reason why such apps or modifications are only available on jailbroken phones (through Cydia, the jailbroken appstore)."|"Q: Is there a (non-jailbroken) iPhone app that works like Android Lock?

I would like to be able to set a different behavior on the Weekends starting Mac Mini at 9:00 for example. Do you know any way to achieve that (third party software, cron job, superuser"|"trick)?

A: Consider using DssW Power Manager. With Power Manager, you can create multiple separate start up and shut down times for weekdays and weekends.
Power Manager goes far beyond the capabilities of pmset. How to schedule your Mac to shut down (screen recording on YouTube).

Disclaimer: I work for DssW.

A: You don't need 3rd party software. The OS X utility pmset allows you to schedule sleep/wake taking day of week into effect. I haven't tested it, but it appears you cannot schedule multiple repeating events on different times. You'll need to use cron to complete this task.

For instance, If I want to copy (to an audio-file) the noise I make while playing a flash game, is there a way to record what is currently to be heard in my headset ?

A: Rogue Amoeba's Audio Hijack Pro can do this for you and much more.

A: If you want to do it for free you can download Audacity and Soundflower (if you have a mac) and record the sound straight off your sound card.
Audacity: http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/
Soundflowerbed:"|"http://cycling74.com/downloads/
Tutorial: http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/User:BillWharrie/Using_Soundflower_to_record_streaming_audio
You mentioned you're using a mac, but for people who run windows, there is likely another program you can substitute for Soundflower to accomplish the same thing, although I have not looked into it.

A: Another option, also from Rogue Amoeba, is Piezo which is about 50% the cost of Audio Hijack Pro. So, depending on how complex your needs are, there are two really great options.

A: Soundflower has been my optimal software for audio routing. You can grab it here: http://cycling74.com/products/soundflower/. Please note that this is only available for Mac. If you own a Windows computer, (or GNU/Linux, Solaris, or FreeBSD, or even Mac as well, in addition to any POSIX-conformant platforms), try JACK at http://jackaudio.org. Both of these are free, so try them out.

A: TapeDeck is another such app to the list. It literally has a nice looking interface featuring a classic tape recorder, with a ""drawer of tapes"" on the side, which is a stack of the recordings that you've made with it before. The data there displays title, time or recording, and the duration.
To record, choose the setting ""Record using system audio recorder"", and it should record the sound straight from your sound card, i.e. whatever comes out of your headphones/speakers. Free evaluation version is available, and if you find it useful for something that you need to do a lot, the full version is worth it. For me, it's been stable and I like the simplicity of the layout, easy little thing that doesn't take too much area on the screen."|"Q: Recording the sound of my Mac Is there a way to capture the currently playing ""sounds"" ?

A: You can use the inbuilt microphone on your computer to record the sound.
To do this, open up your favourite sound recording software (Audacity, for example) and click on the little microphone icon on the bottom of the window.

*Calendar must fully sync with Google Calendar.

Edit:
Another issue: how good is the iPhone's hardware? The hardware on my last smartphone (a Dopod with Win Mobile 5) fell apart ( both in terms of speed and hardware) after a year of use. Do iPhones have similar problems?

If it was my cell, I would dial the number and listen. Is there a similar app for iPods?

A: Your question and Webs' answer answer the question. With me.com, you can send an instant message to your iPod touch. Surely it needs WiFi turned on to receive the message. Additionally you"|"can make the iPod beep for 120 seconds, and you can lock or reset it from remote.

A: My guess is that most locating apps work using location services. Location services works by either triangulating the cell phone over cell connection or GPS. The iPod does not have a GPS or cell radio in it.
I have heard of location services using WiFi location, but then you would need location services installed and my guess is that it is not installed on the iPod. However, if it is, then you could connect to WiFi, turn on location, download an app to find your device, and then find it over WiFi. But accuracy is going to be hindered greatly using location over WiFi. Not to mention you would have to have the WiFi radio on to even find the device in this scenario. Which is impractical and not a good idea for good battery life.
Another option would be an app that when activated turns on the speaker of the iPod and beacons. But you would need a way to remotely turn this feature on. The only options here are Bluetooth and WiFi. Again the idea is hindered by needing one of those two radios always on. Which is impractical.
Probably the best options is one of those key finders. Key Ringer (http://www.keyringer.com/) is one such company. But the downside is you will need one of those bulky devices always attached to the iPod.

A: MobileMe does this for iPod touches (if you have a paid account). You can also send a message and this will make a sound (if your iPod volume is high enough)."|"can also install the Find My iPhone app on your iPod touch. It can help you find your iPod touch if it is lost or stolen.

A: Line 2 says Software Update was running and shows the image (Path) it was loaded from. Line 6, Parent Process, says it was run by the launch daemon, i.e., a scheduled run, not one started manually by you.
The Exception Type, SIGSEGV, is a segment violation -- the program tried to access some memory other than what was allocated to it by the operating system. Possibly it used an uninitialized pointer, or a return-address or some other pointer got over-written which could happen if a buffer on the program stack was over-run.
The rest of the information is pretty much useless without the source code and a load-map, i.e., it's of interest to a programmer trying to find out how the crash occurred, but not really much use to the rest of us.

A: Crash Reports are good for finding out what happened to the program and depending on the circumstances possibly fixing them (eg. Final Cut crashes trying to use more than 2.5GB of memory - close some projects). They're most important to the developer so be sure to pass them on as if the issue is a bug. A related question on SuperUser dealing with kernel panics may be of use as well.
Another good discussion of this topic on StackOverflow, which also links to this Apple Tech. Note
I'll break down the sample crash report:
Process:         SoftwareUpdateCheck [16198]

This information isn't very useful and can be pruned - it is just stating how many crashes and how long it's been since the last crash report has been saved.
Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)

Application Specific Information:

This is the primary information you're looking for - the exception type can tell you what kind of error caused the program to crash (which can be something you can fix or an actual bug), and more specifically what thread crashed. If you have Application Specific Information it doesn't hurt as it may give you an idea about what is being used at the time of the crash.

The above 5 threads of crash information are completely useless to you as a user as they have nothing to do with the crash that is easily discernible. The developer however may need to know what it's doing if dealing with a concurrency (threading) issue.

I am ok with using the command line, Python or applescript if that's the way to go.

A: You can sync libraries one-way with rsync:
rsync -av --force --delete --size-only ~/Music/iTunes /Volumes/johndoe/Music

A detailed writeup is here: Keeping 2 iTunes Libraries in Sync
I actually use this technique myself.
Creates a ""carbon copy"" of a library on another machine which you can then sync to reflect changes.

A: Depending on the functionalities you want : 


*

A: Not a widget, but since there's always a browser around, the Timer Tab web app does the trick for me.

Here's a selection of features:


*

*timer + alarm clock + stopwatch

*works offline

*fullscreen countdown by clicking on the countdown

*keyboard control:

*f: toggle fullscreen, 

*space: toggle pause


*customizable:


*

*audio alarm: any Youtube clip 

*background: any image on the web


*countdown in the browser tab title and tab icon



Now, if Chrome happens to be the browser of your choice, there's also the Chrome app, providing you with some extra features:


*

*optional sound and Chrome notification

*use the ""tab to search"" chrome feature to set the timer

*etc.

507||"Q: Is there a way to power up a Mac Mini remotely? Is there ANY way to Power Up a Mac Mini remotely?
Just to be clear, I don´t mean wake up from sleep but boot up.

A: Depending on how your Mac Mini is connected to the internet (wifi, ethernet, firewall, age of the machine, NAT, …) it should be possible to do it using Wake On LAN.
You could, for example, use a GUI software like WakeOnLan.

A: Not sure what you're trying to accomplish, but it's also possible to use the Energy Saver preference pane to schedule"|"the machine to startup at a set time.

A: As you describe it, no.
You could, however, get another computer or network-controlled device with the ability to cut off/restore power to a device, and remotely operate that (I'll try to find such a controller and link it here in a minute).  Then just set your mac-mini to auto-boot after a power failure.
Edit: example- http://www.42u.com/dataprobe_iboot_remote_reboot.htm

A: As a workaround you can set, in the energy settings a scheduled time for the remote computer to start. At least if others have powered down the computer you know it will power up everyday on its own i.e. 6:00AM
I am setting up a remote MAC in the Philippines and others may power down instead of log off so I know if for example I set it to start everyday at 9:00PM philippine time it will be acccessable to me in the US everyday at 6:00AM.
Another idea if your in the US is to use iDevice, a switch that you plug into the power outlet then plug the MAC into. These are great devices that use apple home kit and I use them to power cycle my remote cameras that freez once in awhile and the company who makes the camera said to power cycle to restore the cameras. These devices use their own internet access and work great unfortunately they only make the 110 vac version. Also you must have the MAC set up to restart on power failure.

Examine the output of that, one should be your “broken” Volume. Once you have it identified, proceed with these steps, all in the Terminal. The first time you execute a command, your password may be required, this is normal.
The output may look like:

So the name you’re after is “MacintoshHD”.  
Step Number One: Disable Spotlight for your Drive.

(I'm using the latest Snow Leopard 10.6.5)

A: Since you mentioned Firesheep, let me put in a plug for Sheepsafe:

Sheepsafe was built to automate the task of switching your network configuration to use a SOCKS proxy whenever you join an untrusted network.
Sheepsafe works by keeping a configuration of known safe wireless networks. When you join an untrusted network, Sheepsafe switches to a network location that has a SOCKS proxy configured and starts a SOCKS proxy by SSH'ing into a remote server, thus protecting your browsing traffic from FireSheep and other snoopers on the local network. When you switch back to a safe network, Sheepsafe switches back to the default, trusted location and shuts down the SOCKS proxy.


A: There are a number of location switch apps that work along with the Location feature such as NetworkLocation and LocationX. A more recent release you could also try is Airport Location 

A: The Location function doesn't let you automatically switch to the
right network configuration.
You have to know that the original Automatic location configuration is a real security hole since it lets all you network interfaces up and doesn't give you a correct information of which one you are riding on.
You can always check by looking at Apple > Location > Network Preferences...
This Automatic configuration is also one of the nightmares of any network engineer."|up?|0.3528997004032135|0.007722007722007722

Should I be concerned?"|"Is there anything I can do?  Is there some kind of ""is my iPod completely &#@!ed?"" diagnostic I should run?  I realize this is kind of a vague question.

A: It could be a low memory issue. iOS is supposed to manage memory automatically, but I've found that it's not always perfect. Try quitting every single app and restart the device (hold the power button down for several seconds, then slide to power off, then power on again) to see if that fixes it.

A: Until recently, iOS apps had no automatic memory management mechanism. Thus, developers had to track memory allocations and release them manually. Most developers were good with this. Apple provides tools to check for various kinds of leaks. This is in contrast to Mac apps, that do have semi-automatic memory management via garbage collection.
Some iOS developers did not perform enough testing, or could not find the cause of the leaks, and the App Store checks only for content, not app malfunctions, although of course, if an app is DOA, it is rejected.
With iOS 5, the situation for iOS developers improved. A new memory management system called Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) was introduced. iOS runtime takes care of memory management in app.
Apple provides a handy tool in Xcode to convert apps to make use of ARC.
So, developers now can improve their apps so that the only crashing that happens is with virtual race cars!

A: I browsed on internet and found that app crashing is associated process to low memory and that's why to adjust the processing speed, it simply shuts off the process. Then reboot, refresh and blah blah blah....
I found 2 main causes:

*

*Refreshing rate: I think iOS devices use Dynamic Ram which needs refreshing/rebooting. When we switch on the iOS device. iOS loads and we never shut it off so the OS stays in RAM. Considering this with PC. We boot and OS comes to RAM, we start process and then after using it we shut down. It means every process which was in RAM was sent back to permanent memory with OS as well.
We generally do not shut off the iPad and that's why the OS has a permanent sector in RAM, As the RAM is dynamic it needs to be refreshed but we do not do. Hence it's virtual memory becomes too low and hanging occurs.


*Single tasking device: one process at a time. So earlier devices do hang and applications crash.

Therefore, I highly suggest that you use Numbers to do the conversion. Since you don't have your Mac anymore, perhaps you could borrow a friend's? Also, if there is an Apple Store near where you live, you could put the file on a flash drive and do the conversion there.

518||Q: My iPod touch takes gigantic videos; how come it takes such tiny photos? Is there any way to take higher resolution|"pictures with it?  The videos are massive!

A: No, you can't currently. 
Im assuming this is a 4th gen iPod Touch - since its the only one with a camera. It can do 720p videos, but it looks like they also limited the picture size to be about the same. This was a large complaint when the new Touch was announced, since the iPhone now has a 5mp camera."|photos? A:Hmm that is a very interesting question! It is indeed quite strange that the iPod touch takes such tiny photos, especially since it is capable of much higher resolution. One possible explanation is that the camera on the iPod touch is designed for video rather than still photography, and the small photos are simply a side effect of this. Another possibility is that the camera is set at a low resolution by default, or is somehow damaged. If you are interested in higher resolution photos, you may want to try some third-party apps that offer more advanced camera controls. Overall it sounds like your iPod touch is taking photos that are not quite what you were hoping for, but there are likely some workarounds or settings that could improve the quality.

  an open-source, cross-platform x86

A: I remember seeing a remote control ir attachment somewhere for sale.  You could use it as a fancy remote. 

A: I would dock it to a Sony or Bose ipod-dock-alarm-clock, leaving it permanently on my bedside table as my alarm-clock-ipod.
For extra coolness points, you should turn it into a robot.  See the people making ""cell phone robots?"".   Yours would have to be untethered since you have no wifi or other connectivity.

522||"Q: 3G Access Only for iPad? I am considering recommending an iPad for an older relative that currently has no computer and no Internet access. I get reasonable 3G reception from this person's home. Internet access options start at roughly $60/month. So, I am considering recommending a 3G iPad and using only the 3G service for Internet access.  
Obviously this would be slower than a high speed Wi-Fi connection, but it would also be much cheaper and I think it might be adequate. I am wondering if anyone has"|"experience with using 3G as the primary internet connection source.

A: I use my iPad all day at work for email, web browsing, etc. on 3G and it works fine without Wi-Fi for everyday use.
From a speed perspective, don't sweat it.  For a user who obviously doesn't sound accustomed to blazing broadband, I think 3G will be just fine. Internet is fast enough, Netflix works, and YouTube and the like are fast enough (although YouTube seems to limit the quality of the streams, but it's good enough).
EDIT: The original version of this answer highlighted why an iPad would not function properly without a computer, which is not true since the release of iOS 5.

A: I can't speak about the iPad specifically, but I've used 3G through Verizon as my primary Internet connection for about 4 years.  Ii actually started out as 1xRTT, but the cell tower were upgraded.  My choices are either 3G, satellite (line-of-site to the satellite may be a problem), or dialup.  The joys of country living.
I haven't had any problems with it.  Some things are slow: PS3 updates, large downloads, etc., but its fine for email, web browsing, etc.  My account is old enough that its doesn't have download limits.  I think I hit 7GB last month.  

A: Would the 3g plan include enough data?
Where I am, the cheapest 3g iPad plans are a little cheaper than the cheapest ""lite"" 1 mbit/s wired plan, but that iPad plan only includes 250 mbytes of data a month.

Is there a setting somewhere I"|"can use to indicate that yes, I am sure I want to open ""Amazon MP3 Downloader"" without this dialog box?

A: If you need to do this manually on a file (or files) you can run the following command to remove the Quarantine flag:
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /PATH/TO/FILE(S)

So in your case since the quarantine flag is not being removed you will want to run the command with sudo as the primary cause for the flag not being removed after hitting ""Open"" is because you don't have permissions to do so.

A: Create a file called com.apple.DownloadAssessment.plist under Library/Preferences with the following:
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN""
   ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"">

*

*Sync with iPhoto/Aperture is not an option: they wouldn't end up in the camera roll

*Opening from email or dropbox one by one and saving them is not an option: too many!

*A big email is not feasible


AirSharing and Dropbox apps are apparently of little help, since I couldn't find a “save all” command.
Any suggestion is welcome, third party apps too!

A: Phoneview - is a great option.  It's fast too.  Connect iphone, copy the files to your desired directory, disconnect.  Connect other iphone, copy files to desired location on iphone.  Boom!
Drag n drop ease.  Free download, and cheap too. edit: it allows you to see entire disk media"|"folder :)


A: You can use "" PicBack - Photo Transfer App "" it works with a regular USB cable, which is 3x faster than WiFi transfer and there is absolutely no third-party software to install
it imports photos and videos directly To camera roll and it can also find duplicated photos , very handy and very easy to use, you can find it at the app store
""https://itun.es/i6BG5cC""
Give that a try ;)

A: The app GoodReader can save videos to Camera Roll. Simply transfer files to GoodReader via iTunes, then in GoodReader select ""Manage Files"" -> ""Export"" -> ""Save to Photots"".

A: there is another free way to transfer one photo or many photos from iPhone to computer. That is, you can use Apple's Wifi Photo Transfer to do it. The only disadvantage is that your iPhone and computer should on the same Wifi networks.

A: One way to transfer photos to your camera roll:
Send the photo via email to yourself.
When you open the email on your iphone tap the photo once; camera roll message appears you tap on the camera roll icon and voila! it's transferred to camera roll.

A: Check out an app called Folder Plus. 
Very minimalist design, easy to understand and packed full of useful functionality. Seriously it is one of the best apps when it comes to working with files on your phone. Photos, music, videos, and even incompatible files can be stored and/or passed through the app to their destination. I think there is a free version and a paid version on the Apple App Store. 
And there is a free OS X companion app that really makes quick work of any files you want to move onto or from your phone called Folder Plus USB. It requires Mavericks or later to run on your Mac.
For the record: I have no affiliation with the maker of this app in any way. It really is just a great little program that has gone under the radar for a long time.

A: Use AirDrop!
There's an (admittedly non-obvious) way to ""select all"" images in camera roll.
Follow the description given here: https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/use-trick-quickly-select-all-photos-videos-your-iphone-bulk-delete-share-0312925/
Basically select at least the two newest images by sliding over them with a finger. Then without lifting this finger, use another finger to tap the top of the screen. The screen will immediately jump-scroll to the oldest picture and all pictures will have been selected by this process.
Now you can AirDrop them as usual.

A: Bump https://bu.mp/ can do this.
Also try PhotoSync.

For your non-iTunes Store content I'd recommend Senuti (read it backwards!) which lets you copy music from your iPhone or iPad back to your mac. Senuti costs $18, but there's a trial version, which can transfer up to 1000 songs.
Neither of these require a jailbreak.

If your problem is that you have to type cmd+k every time you want to connect to a dfs share, you could always -once connected- drag that share to the right side of the dock, where it will create a direct access to the share. Next time you click on that, if the share is not connected, it will try to do that. This works for any type of connection (at least Windows Shares work too and I recall using nfs).

I could probably keep going.  The iPad has become an essential device for me.

A: I use it mainly to read my rss feeds in the morning. It has pretty much replaced my laptop in the lounge at night, while the desktop still remains for serious processing power when needed.

A: I didn't get the memo about the iPad only being for 'consumption'. I do a lot of painting on my iPad...

A: With log me in for iPad, I can control my Mac/PC remotely so that I don't need to carry my Macbook pro anymore at a meeting. 
With GPS drive motion X, I have a cool GPS, so I don't need a TomTom anymore. 

A: I am a financial blogger, but wrote an article about Evernote on the iPad. The article addresses how to use ""Bookmarklets"" on the iPad. These are little Java scripts that can let you clip a page to Evernote (one of the killer iPad apps) save a bookmark to deli.cio.us or other. Between these two apps, when I am away from home and surfing on the iPad, it's easy to save items for further review.

A: Today, I've used exclusively my iPad at work.  I checked emails, made some transactions on the Web-based ERP, used the VPN and called with my Cisco Mobile Phone on the iPad, and attended a Webex meeting.
The battery lasted for the whole workday.

A: The iPad is just an entertainment device.  It's good for viewing movies, checking email, playing games, but for not for real functionality that work would require.

A: I'm very happy with Air Video(*). Lifehacker have a feature on it.
(*) Have only used it on an iPhone, no iPads in Sweden yet :-(

A: Try StreamToMe. It is free and works quite well.

A: TVersity works great for me. Basically, you set up a home server (it's all web-based) and it will convert real-time. Seeking is a bit of an issue, though apparently they're working on it.

A: I use SubSonic to stream music from my"|"library at home to my iPad (among other devices). It works well.

A: Air Video works much fine on iPad like it's on iPhone.

A: I've been using ZumoCast for quite some time now and like it. It's been stable on my Windows XP HTPC and streams to my iPhone and iPad are great. It transcodes all kinds of formats on the fly. I've yet to see an encoding or format trip it up.
One feature I quite like about it is it'll transcode and store the stream to the media on my phone. So I can set it up at night, on my phone, to bring down a bunch of transcoded video files and have my own in-flight entertainment on the plane in the AM.
It should also let to stream when you're off of your home network but I don't ever use that feature.

A: I have a feeling this won't be what you are looking for, but this is what Apple's Home Sharing is more or less designed to do. You'd just have to make sure all of the music and videos are imported into iTunes and that iTunes is running on the computer and the iPad and iTunes are using the same Apple ID.

A: I'm surprised to not see Plex mentioned yet.  Plex is both a media server, front end GUI for watching on a computer and mobile app for streaming content from your media server.  It is extremely straight forward to set up both for at home use and remote streaming via a free Plex account.  The computer version is free and the iOS app is $5.
You can download Plex for your PC at https://plex.tv/downloads and Plex for your iOS device at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plex/id383457673?mt=8
I've used both for 3-4 years now, often to watch content stored at home while traveling, with little to no complaints.
With that said.  I know that Plex can connect to your iTunes library and play it through the home theater interface but I don't know that this same functionality is present in the iOS app.

EDIT: So it turns out I was killing (word choice?) the Safari browser (and the Chrome browser for that matter). When I just Quit the browser my previous browsing is always maintained... So rather than get an extension or anything I believe the solution is just to Quit the browser?

A: I have been using SafariRestore from Safari Extensions. It"|"works quite well. 

A: Just reopening after quitting Safari doesn't seem to restore the windows for me. (Or anymore?)
So to summarize:

*History — Reopen All Windows from Last Session or History — Reopen Last Closed Window

*SafariRestore, Sessions or SaveTabs

*Glims or Saft

*Bookmarks — Add Bookmark for These ␣ Tabs...

*In Lion there's Safari — Quit and Keep Windows (⌥⌘Q)


A: May I suggest, the free extension, Sessions. It restores last session and even saves sessions for later retrieval. It's stable with useful features like search, export, remove duplicates, micro-management, KB shortcuts & startup behavior settings.

A: After starting Safari, you can go to History -> Reopen All Windows from Last Session to have Safari reopen the windows and tabs that were open when you last used it. 
There's some additional info in this question: Is it possible to restart an application using AppleScript?, including a script (Chealion's answer) that can be modified to start Safari and call that menu automatically. 

A: There are lots of Safari Extensions here... Some of them are Session Managers which will sure do what you want ;-)

A: Not automatically, but you can click ""Bookmarks \ Add Bookmark for These 3 Tab"" which will create a folder containing bookmarks for all the currently open tabs.

A: As mentioned in the edited question, the solution seems to be to just Quit (command+Q) the browser rather than killing/restarting etc.

A: Glims will remember the history of your previous session, like Firefox and Chrome do. None of the other suggestions here will do that. They'll only show the last page you looked at in those tabs."|restores the last session when you restart Safari.|0.39233994483947754|0.05017921146953405

I add the hidden network by selecting ""other"" and entering the SSID. There is no security right now in order to simplify troubleshooting. When the iPod 4 sleeps, goes out of range or the wifi radio is turned off and then on, the iPod will not re-connect to the hidden SSID once within range again. Strange, considering I reset the network configurations before setting up the 1 and only network the iPod 'knows' as well as having installed a configuration profile on the iPod with the wi-fi settings for this hidden SSID. Nothing i try seems to get the iPod to connect automatically. The hidden SSID does appear in the list of networks when I go into wireless settings, but thats not good enough - the iPod needs to connect to the hidden network without any user intervention.
I should mention the router is a cisco aironet 1100 series AP. The AP has 2 SSIDs: the hidden network and a ""Guest"" network, and it is broadcasting the Guest network. The Subnets are different, in case anyone was wondering. Also, No, i cannot broadcast the hidden SSID; I'm not looking to change the network settings.

Thanks,

A: *

*Note -- I haven't tested this or worked with a similar configuration *


It isn't clear from your description -- does the iPod auto connect to the ""Guest"" network?
If it does, in the Wi-Fi settings I would (in the WiFi settings) turn ""Ask to Join Networks"" off then tell the machine to forget the ""Guest"" network, then connect to the hidden network again and then sleep the device and see if it reconnects to the hidden network.
Or -- Go to Settings then General then Reset and then Reset Network Settings, then power off and power on the device, then reconnect to the hidden network.
Or -- you could also try Apple's iPhone Configuration Utility, which allows you to set profiles for iOS devices. I haven't messed with this at all, but some folks have mentioned it as a fix.

A: Okay, so this solved the issue for me. Could ber completely wrong because my fix isnt ipod/Iphone related, although the same proplems described above have happened to my ipod.
*Please note: Precedure will vary for other routers. These instructions are specific to Netgear DGN2000 Wireless-N Router with Built-in DSL Modem.
Step 1. Using your computer, log into your routers login/Manager page. my default login address is  * http://192.168.0.1 *
Step 2. Under setup (on the left hand side) click Wireless Settings.
Step 3. In the first section under ""Wireless Network"" there is a sub-heading ""Mode"".
Select the desired wireless mode. The options are:
* g & b   - Both 802.11g and 802.11b wireless stations can be used.
* g only   - Only 802.11g wireless stations can be used.
* b only   - All 802.11b wireless stations can be used. 802.11g wireless stations can still be used if they can operate in 802.11b mode.
* Up to 130 Mbps   - Wireless stations that support up to 130 Mbps can be used, such as the WN511B. In this case, your router will transmit two streams with different data in the same channel at the same time.
* Up to 270 Mbps   - Wireless stations that support up to 270 Mbps can be used, such as the WN511B. Your router will run in channel expansion mode to achieve 270Mbps. This mode will support 40MHz or 20MHz bandwidth. The router will transmit data with expansion or no expansion frame by frame to avoid interference from other APs/clients data transmission. 

The default is ""Up to 130 Mbps"", which allows all 11b and 11g wireless stations. The NETGEAR WN511B runs at 126 Mbps or 270 Mbps when accessing this router. 
Mine was set on ""Up to 270 Mbps"" mode. the iPod/iPhone's do not support this mode very well.
THe best choice i found was the ""Up to 130 Mbps"" mode.
My iPod connected straight away and has worked perfectly with my hidden network.
Step 4. Be sure to save and apply your settings.
If this helps anyone, please post a reply. Interested to know if this is ""one"" solution to what could be one of many problems on this topic, actually works for others.

A: Interesting scenario, I don’t believe there’s an existing easy solution to this problem. Part of the problem in solving this particular issue, is that the iPod (and its iOS) are fairly closed environments where you can hardly modify anything beyond what the UI offers. If the device is not reconnecting (despite having knowledge of the network), there’s no magic option to “flip” and expect it to work; especially considering that you’ve stated that nothing on the networking side should/must be changed. Even if changing certain network parameters in the router were allowed by you, I don’t recall anything that could help you there. You might want to try (for the sake of testing) disabling the “other” network, or little things like that. Not because you will necessarily reach a solution, but at least you might find the root of the problem or the cause and either find a workaround or… spiritually deal with it. ;)"|"Q: Can iOS 4 connect automatically to a closed network with a hidden SSID?

Originally I used the default headphones that came with my iPhone, but as they got wet with sweat, one or the other earbud would stop functioning temporarily... eventually after many workouts, the 'phones just died (I'm assuming it's the sweat, since I have another set of the same headphones from a similar period that work fine)

*A stereo headset with microphone so I can answer calls and do voice commands

*Ones that are made to be sweat resistant and durable

*(Preferably) bluetooth so I can put my phone in my pannier or on the treadmill shelf.


Anyone with suggestions?

A: I use the default Blackberry wired headset which I get on Amazon.  
I wear them only when I ride my bike to talk on the phone (call family on the 2 hour bike ride to work, its a good time to chat on the way home) or listen to podcasts.
While they may not be sweat resistant, they are cheap.  I buy them on Amazon for $2.85 a pair and the noise cancelling seems to be pretty good, considering I often talk while riding a bike in traffic and wind.
I have had one mike die due to sweat, but otherwise, they seem to last reasonably well.  And I sweat copiously, alas.
I love the single click to mute, hold to drop the call, and hold to activate voice dialing on my Blackberry.   Now to figure out how to get the BB voice dialer to call via Google Voice so I can call my parents in Canada without long distance charges from the US.

A: I have been using Motorola MOTOROKR S9 BT Stereo Headphones very successfully (outdoors, gym) for past 1.5 yrs. All 3 of your points fit to the T. They are a bit expensive but the experience & usability is worth it. The link I have posted is the HD (High Def) version, you may not need that. You may also want to check deals on Amazon, they almost always have better price.
PS: See if you can try it on first. It fits nicely on my frame but I've heard they're not always as comfortable on others.

A: Could you maybe get swimmers headphones (completely water resistant) and a headphone - microphone adapter. Would cost more than the disposable blackberry approach but be better for the environment.

A: When I was in the Apple shop Liverpool the other day I noticed some Sennheiser/Adidas ones, the CX680i, which look like they would fit your requirements perfectly."|Q: Decent sweat-resistant headphones with mic (ie, iPhone compatible) Similar to this question already posed: Decent headphones with a Mic for Android and iPhone, I'm looking for a pair of decent sweat resistant headphones that are good for working out.|0.37904834747314453|0.06132075471698113

However, I have a disc that came with another computer.  Is it possible to install Mac OS X on the first computer using the disc I have? Do I need a serial number for this?

A: The only Mac OS X that does have serial numbers is Server versions 10.6 and earlier. They know are licensed for 10 or unlimited users.
The only problem you may run into is that if you are trying to do the reinstall with a system"|"disk rather than a plain old Mac OS disk. 
Say that other computer is a iMac and you are using the system disk from that one (one of those gray disks). The installers do have a little bit of code in them that check machine types, and may not let you install. Or, you may be able to install the OS, but none of the other applications (mainly iLife, etc). 
This is not to hard to get around, since the main installer is what is checking - if you dig down on the disk, you can find the actual installer, which should work. 

A: Mac OS X doesn’t have (nor had in the past) Serial Number or “Legit Purchase” mechanism. You can buy/borrow/lend/steal/copy a copy of Snow Leopard (or any other edition) and install it on any number of Machines.
Technically this is possible, however, according to the EULA and all the legal stuff, you can’t; in any case, the operating system doesn’t have any copy-protection mechanism.
EDIT: Bear in mind that a plain OS X Snow Leopard disk is not the same as a recovery disk. Although a recovery disk contains the OS, it is usually tied to a particular model, so if you try to recover a Macbook Pro with the iMac recovery disk, that might not work. (This has happened to me in the past trying to recover the other way around, a friend’s iMac’s HDD failed and he replaced it but couldn’t find his recovery disk. We tried to use my Macbook Pro’s disk but it wouldn’t work. The same with my Mac Pro. 
Going to an Apple Store will possibly help in that case. In the end I found my Snow Leopard’s original disk and we used that to install his iMac. 

A: There's no serial number to enter when installing Mac OS X.

A: It's probably not an easy way but since there have been some apps snuck into the app store that had hidden tethering abilities: http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/07/apple-approves-pulls-flashlight-app-with-hidden-tethering-mode/ It's clearly possible to do this in an app but not one that will be in the official store. One way around this would be to spend the $99 for a developer account, find some source code, compile it and install it onto your device. Don't mind the hand waving around finding appropriate source code though.

544||Q: WiFi Connection Lost Periodically - Must Reboot iPod Touch to Restore I have a 2nd generation iPod Touch running OS 4 that I (usually) leave powered on 24x7. What I notice that I am unable to go online - I cannot check my email, browse the web, etc. My guess is that my wireless router's DHCP tables have recycled (or whatever the right word is) and that|"the iPod Touch needs to renew its IP address.
If I go to the iPod Touch's Settings it lists my network and the DHCP-granted IP address, DNS settings, and so forth. If I try to renew the lease the existing settings are erased and the iPod thinks for a while before bringing up a new IP address. However, this new one starts with 169.254 (or something like that) when it should start with 192.168. Needless to say, the connectivity problems persist.
The only way I can get back online is to power down the iPod Touch then power it back on, which takes upwards of a minute. Is this a known problem with the iPod Touch? Is it an issue with my router? Am I stuck rebooting the iPod Touch when this situation unfolds?
Thanks!

A: Numbers starting with 169... are self assigned numbers and means the iPhone can't find a DHCP server to connect to.
This used to happen to my iPhone on an earlier OS version (3 point something). I haven't seen it for a while. Switching to and from ""Airplane Mode"" was enough to get the iPhone to acquire a new address.

Anyone know of another company that made the ADB-to-USB converters? Even better if they still"|"do!

A: The iMate was the only converter available on the market.
If you do get an iMate, the only thing it will work with these days are keyboards and mice. It internally converts ADB keyboard and mice commands to USB keyboard and mice commands, so it will just make your ADB mouse and keyboard look like a USB mouse and keyboard to the computer, no drivers required.
In ~2001 there was a driver for the iMate that would actually configure it as an ADB bus the computer could see, that way anything with real ADB drivers could use it just like a builtin port. That driver has not been updated in years, and Apple dropped all ADB support from OS X, so at this point USB emulation is the only thing it does. Not that there were many (any?) interesting ADB devices that were supported under Mac OS X anyway.

A: Find a matching vintage CPU, install an old linux on it with ADB drivers, and then send the resulting keystrokes over IP.
Or you could buy a nice new low-profile aluminum Apple keyboard. It'll be cleaner, more comfortable, and cheaper.

A: FYI there appears to be another USB to ADB adapter out there as well Micro Connectors USB ADB Adapter. Good luck with your search.

A: ADB is over ten years old.

When I open up the backup folder, I see a bunch of files named with long GUIDs. Each app that saves data (e.g. to a SQLite table will have a file here.
How can I find out which GUID represents a specific app I am looking for?
I used to be able to use findstr ""app name"" *.mdinfo and then find the"|"corresponding *.mddata file, but as of iTunes 10, there are no *.mdinfo files. This makes it so you can't find the app's name in the files in plain text. So when I try to use findstr ""app name"" *.*, it doesn't find it either. The files have no extension, and if they are SQLite files, they are in binary format and after examining them, they have no information related to the app's name in them.

A: This used to be possible with Erica Sadun's mdhelper program.  Unfortunately, it looks like something has changed in the way Apple stores backup files w/ iOS 4.2, and the program cannot achieve the same results (since it finds no mdbackup or mdinfo files).

Basically as long as the host computer is authorised for iTunes use, you can connect your old iPod, right click on the icon from within iTunes and select Transfer Purchases to get the apps onto iTunes. Then connect the target device and sync the applications to it.

A: I did this very thing when I moved from an iPod Touch to an iPhone last year. Basically, iTunes takes care of all the issues. Simply plug in your new iPhone and synch over all the content you have - apps, music and videos. You do not have to de-register your iPod Touch. You can still continue to use that gadget in parallel with the new iPhone.

556||"Q: Application DRM I wanted to know if there is a standard way of making licenses on Mac OS 10.6. For exemple, if I am creating an application and I want to create a licensing system, do I leave a file somewhere in the system that my application can read/write?

A: Mac OS X Applications, tend to be limited due to the UNIX “open” nature of the operating system. Contrary to Windows for example, where one could bury an entry into the Registry under any name, provided you’re given Admin privileges (which is very natural in Windows). 
Under OS X, applications are forced to use dedicated locations for storing settings and preferences. ~/Library and /Library. 
With that being said, this doesn’t stop some applications to use other mechanisms in conjunction with that. 
I cannot name them all primary because I don’t know all of the existing ways, but I can tell you some common forms:
Serial"|"Number / License Key:  These are the typical. The program stores an “encrypted” copy of these values in its preferences (sometimes even unencrypted), usually located in:


*

*~/Library/Preferences or /Library

*The Application Bundle itself 

*Some value in the user’s Home folder (possibly hidden by a .)


The problem with these are obvious, the serials get published/shared/copied and you have no way to stop it. Some applications have a “blacklist” of serials that although perfectly formatted, are internally hardcoded to be bad. 
Online Activation: Less common (and usually more annoying), these require the app to connect to an online host to “activate” or “validate” the license. This prevents a lot of fraud and usually ends with the application cracked by some genius, where the code that does the validation is simply modified to always return “ok” making the application believe that the internet stuff went ok.  Read: Adobe Products.
In any case, the program has to store the value somewhere, and the usual locations apply. 
Tied with Hardware ID This is common too, they extract your drive’s serial number and some other parameters (Network card MAC Address for example) and they create a serial number that checks for those. So even if you “copy” the license, the new machine won’t have the same values and it will fail. This is annoying because if your hard drive crashes and you boot from a backup, you’ll have to re-register.

A: There is no set ""standard way"", you would have to either build your own from scratch or use one of the online store frameworks.
It sounds like what you want would be best suited by the Mac App Store. You'll need to join the Mac Developer Program to get access to it. It's $99 a year.

A: DRM is handled by apple automatically if you use the appledev store submittal.
The DRM apple uses is extremely kept information, obviously the record labels and video studios demand this, as apple would love to not deal with it, per Steves frequent emails and other public letters.
I need more info regarding what you want to DRM, type of content, iOS app, or perhaps you need a simple license /registration procedure, for an OSX.app.

Just now, upon taking my iPhone 4 out of my pocket where it lives, I was faced with a screen saying ""iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it"" (see below - screenshot mysteriously still worked). The only thing it would let me do was dial emergency calls. The phone was not noticeably any warmer than usual when idle. Are there any known issues with this?


A: This happened to my brother's iPhone 4 a few times. When he took it to the Apple Store, they ran a special diagnostic"|"that revealed the phone had reached 200 degrees inside. Needless to say, the phone was replaced.

A: From the User's Guide:

If the interior temperature of iPhone exceeds normal operating temperatures, you may experience the following as it attempts to regulate its temperature:  
  
  
*
  
*iPhone stops charging  
  
*display dims  
  
*weak cellular signal   
  
*temperature warning screen appears  
  
  
  Important: You cannot use iPhone while the temperature warning screen is displayed except to make an emergency call. If none of the above measures succeeds in lowering the internal temperature, iPhone automatically goes into a deep sleep mode until it cools. You cannot make an emergency call when iPhone is in this mode. Move iPhone to a cooler location and wait a few minutes before trying to use iPhone again.

There have been numerous cases of all sorts of consumer electronics melting/exploding, and these have often been settled with lawsuits. It is appropriate that the iPhone take preemptive measures to avoid such accidents. 

A: This is a long shot but maybe there's a process going on in the background that's using a lot of processor cycles.
Consider double clicking the home button and quitting everything running and shutting the iPhone down, then restarting it.
Consider turning off bluetooth to see if that's an issue.

A: I left my IPhone in car's passenger seat while cleaning garage and had the same message when I retrieved the phone.  It was a hot South Florida July day and the phone was hot to the touch.  Took phone inside and after it ""cooled off"", started to work again as normal.

564||"Q: What would it take to make an iPad support multiple user accounts? As a mobile computer, the iPad is very personal, but it also begs to be shared. And that's a problem. I don't want my friends to be able to check my emails or delete my high score when they play with it.
Being based on OS X, iOS could theoretically support multiple user accounts. But adding new users (even if done correctly) wouldn't play nice with iTunes.
So, what about partitioning the hard drive and installing several instances of iOS? Add a screen early in the boot process that allows you to choose the partition, and thus the user.
Itunes would thus be able to sync many users separately on the same device, depending on the chosen partition.
To be clearer: I'm not just asking the question, I want to actually do it. Can anybody suggest means to achieve this?
Continued my research: apparently, it is possible to modify"|"the Boot Rom (cf. Limera1n).

A: One place to look might be at dual booting an iPhone with Android.
Update: iUsers for iPad now makes this possible. Check out the video.

A: iOS caters to both the iPhone and the iPad. Multi-user support on the iPhone would be superfluous. Multi-user support on the iPad but not on the iPhone would imply considerable fragmentation of the iOS platform. 
If Apple really wanted to include multi-user support in iOS, partitioning the flash storage and installing several instances of iOS would not be the proper way to go about it. Multi-user support should be accomplished with one instance of iOS and different folders constituting different users' home directories, as is the case with major desktop operating systems. Then user permissions are to be implemented so that one user cannot view another user's files or folders, and thus cannot not read that user's email, etc.
Though multi-user support can be properly implemented on the iPad, it is uncalled for as ""portable devices"" are often ""personal devices"".

A: No non-jailbroken iOS device (publicly) supports multiple accounts, even if one could partition the storage. I have no experience with jailbroken devices so I can't speak to that scenario.
I've seen multiple blog entries lamenting the lack of a feature to lock certain types of content (and they even offered up a couple interesting solutions, too).

A: iOS itself supports multiple user accounts, but SpringBoard doesn't support them, as it's tied heavily to the mobile user. Some people have put together mods that allow you to add more accounts for the UI/SpringBoard if you're jailbroken, but support for the ones I can find have dissipated.

A: As this question was asked and last answered a long time ago - things have (slightly) changed today. There is indeed a (limited) multi-user support today for iPads in the educational market. Multiple managed AppleID accounts can be used on a single device and thus it can be shared among several people. There is more information regarding this here:
http://www.apple.com/education/
http://www.apple.com/education/products/#ipad-assistant

Even if students share an iPad, they can make it their own.
Shared iPad is a new feature in iOS 9.3 We designed it for schools that use a shared device model but still want to provide personalized experiences. Before class begins, you can assign any iPad to any student in your classroom. Students know which devices to use because their pictures are on the Lock screens.

Alternatively, you could add an additional modifier, e.g., ⌃-⌥-space. Or even change it altogether. I've used ⌃-⌘-F in the past, for example; though that's now the default key for Full Screen on Lion.
The default Spotlight keys are the main conflict with Terminal.

UPDATE: The one other thing I think you should try is make sure your iPhone has the latest iOS it can support.

There is a pretty easy fix for this and here is how it works:
Simply double tap the icon of the application that gives you trouble and wait for a few seconds. It should then be available.

A: The flash storage makes a huge difference (a fresh system boots in about 15 seconds, apps will start instantly etc.), and the new MBA does not need to throttle the CPU when it gets hot.

A:The performance of the 2009 MacBook Air will likely improve somewhat with the later model, as the processor and memory are slightly faster.

However, keep in mind that the 2009 model uses a standard 2.5"" SATA hard drive, while the 2010 model has a smaller, faster SSD.

A: You don’t specify your OS but if you have OS/X, then you probably have iLife, then you have iMovie. Merging all that with iMovie is extremely trivial. Just import the videos to iMovie and compose the final movie using all the parts you want to use. 
Effects, Transitions and Captions are a bonus ;)

A: Quicktime Pro is a must-have in such situation. iMovie is great if you need a simple tool, but you may loose quality in the process.

A: Yes, Quicktime can connect 2 Mpeg4s but if you want to upload to a video platform like Youtube or Vimeo they will still appear as 2 videos and will not upload properly. They must be ""stitched"" together by a program designed to do this. There are 3 ways to do this that I know of.

*

*Importing each MP4 into an editing program, editing them together and exporting the sequence to Mpeg4 (if your Editor has this capability. If not you must export at whatever formats your editor allows and then encode the sequence in another program). This is time-consuming and there will be a small loss in quality depending on your Editor as you have encoded them twice (on Import and then again on export).

*There are apps designed to stitch multiple Mp4s together like the free ""MP4 Joiner"". They will do it quickly and work well if each Mp4 compression parameters match. For example if one has a resolution of 1920 X 1080 and the other is 1280 X 720 or if one was compressed at 4000 Kbps (Kilobytes per second) and the other at 5000 Kbps or if different codecs were used the app cannot connect them.

*You could use a professional compression/encoder program like Sorenson Squeeze, Telestream Episode, Apple Compressor, or Adobe Media Encoder and re-encode your Mp4s to Mp4 using the same settings. These are expensive programs but will do the job without quality loss.  There are others programs that can do the job for far less money or even free like Handbrake, just Google Mp4 Encoders. If you use a decent program there will be little or no loss in quality.


A: Well, I'm late to the game but the best way IMHO would be to just use mp4joiner and be done with it.
It just does one thing, merging mp4 files, and does it really well and simple.

Does anyone know where I can get replacement feet?  I looked on Ebay to no avail.
EDIT:
Well thanks for the answers so far, however nothing is turning up.  I just got off the phone with the Genius bar at the local Apple store, and they said it simply doesn't exist.  They want to sell me an entire ""Lower Case"" ... big $$$ for something so trivial.
Still looking for more suggestions.

A: I had an old Powerbook G3 that had lost 2 of it's rubber feet."|"Instead of trying to replace them with the same ones, I just went to a hardware store and bought the little rubber stick-on feet that you could put on the bottom of furniture or a TV stand or whatever. Cost all of about 99 cents and worked perfectly.
They looked something like this:


A: I just got back from the Genius bar and actually had the exact same issue.  I had two feet fail, both having different attachment methods.  The foot under the upper left of the keyboard was attached without any adhesive, the foot had plastic ""feet"" that ""snapped"" into a black metal piece attached to the bottom case.  The foot under the lower left of the keyboard was attached with adhesive to the outside of the bottom case and further secured with an additional plastic ring running along the inside of the bottom case (this ring broke apart from the foot in addition to the adhesive failing on my machine).
I went to the local Genius bar and the cost of the bottom case ended up being covered by apple care.  Even if apple care had not covered the bottom case, the bottom case was only $38.89.

A: You can find a set of 4 replacement feet (along with other Mac replacement parts) at PowerBook Medic

A: They sell the set of 4 here. You can also get a single foot.
http://www.pbparts.com/shop.php//0761398.html

A: You might be able to get some from Apple, I would try there first. Otherwise I do not believe there is an vendor for them.
You could consider molding some foam feet, or custom making your own. Otherwise just deal with it. I've seen several people who either made their own substitute or gone without.

A: It has been a few years since I had to replace any of the feet on my laptops (the current ones are pretty well attached), but they used to provide them for free at Apple retail stores if you asked at the Genius Bar. They probably have them now unless they are bonded to the bottom case."|I found a great solution on Amazon. I ordered a set of 4 replacement feet for my Powerbook G3. The set cost less than $10.00 and included 4 rubber feet and 4 metal spacer blocks. The metal spacers were used to raise the height of the feet so that the laptop would sit level on a flat surface. The rubber feet were a perfect fit and replaced the missing feet on the laptop.

576||"Q: Possible to Hide Mac Partition When in Windows? I've found out that if I install Windows 7 and use the Snow Leopard Boot Camp drivers (Which I need for the graphics chipset drivers.), the Mac partition appears and is read-only. I'm quite concerned about this, because if my Windows partition is infected with malware, it could be a possibility that the hackers could take data from my Mac partition, even if it was read-only.
Is there any way to turn off Mac partition support while booted in Windows?

A: I'm not a windows guy, so the steps are probably different but this SuperUser question asks how to disable a partition under Windows XP. The steps may be similar under Windows 7:

You could remove the drive letter
  assignment for the specific
  partition(s):
  
  
*
  
*Go to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Computer
  Management
  
*Expand Computer Management"|"(Local) > Storage > Disk Management
  
*Right click the specific partition you like to hide and select ""Change
  Drive Letter and Paths""
  
*Select the drive letter shown, click ""Remove"" and click ""OK""
  


A: From a theoretical standpoint, even if you delete the Boot Camp drivers and/or remove the drive letter, a virus could still interface with the disk at very low level and read your data. From a practical standpoint, this is unlikely to happen as there is much more low-hanging fruit for hackers.
Still, if you want to run Windows on your Mac without the possibility, even theoretical, of the compromised Windows system being able to access your Mac data, you have essentially two options:


*

*Run Windows in a VM and only allow it access to its virtual disk

*Turn FileVault on for your user account


For the latter option the theoretical virus could still access your applications and general system settings, but it would not be able to access any user data without the FileVault password.

A: Remove the following keys from the Windows Registry (backup first) to disable the Apple HFS driver:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AppleHFS]
""Type""=dword:00000002
""ErrorControl""=dword:00000001
""Start""=dword:00000000
""Group""=""File System""

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AppleMNT]
""Type""=dword:00000002
""ErrorControl""=dword:00000001
""Start""=dword:00000000
""Group""=""File System""

You can use the same registry fragment above to restore HFS functionality if you forgot to backup your registry before making any changes.

A: I’m sure someone with more Windows experience will provide a better alternative here, because if that is possible, it’s only possible through a Windows setting/hack/etc. I’m sure you can find the HFS+ driver and uninstall it from windows… but I don’t use bootcamp. :(

A: In Windows, you can go into Disk Management and choose ""Change Drive Letter and Paths..."" and then Remove the existing drive letter. Then it won't show up in My Computer etc.

A: I hid my mac partition (macbppkpro) in windows this way:


*

*Boot in Mac

*Open SystemPreferences(Apple Icon on Topleft Corner)

*Go to ""Security and Privacy""

*Click on ""FileVault"" tab

*Click on the Lock Icon - ""Bottom left corner""

*Supply your credentials

*""Turn on FileVault"" button enables - now click on it to encrypt your mac drive. this might take approximately two hours depending on the size of partition.

I know that even some Apple's apps are not yet 64bit - I guess this means something. I also have read that there is no big difference except for maybe driver software. What do you think?

A: You can also change the icon just as you would normally for any other folder or file in Mac OS X:


*

*Copy the image you want to use as your icon. Ideally it should be 512x512 already.

*Choose Get Info on the file/folder/app in Finder

*Click on the Icon and you'll notice a blue outline on the icon - now press Command-V or choose Paste from the Edit menu.



(Screenshot taken from Super User question 37811)

A: To complement the existing, helpful answers:


*

*The accepted answer works in principle, but:


*

*relies on extended attributes of the HFS+ filesystem, which are lost when copying the bundle to a filesystem that doesn't support them. For instance, you cannot store a custom icon in a Git repository.

*the icon displayed by the bundle itself, such"|"as when showing an alert, is still the original icon.


*percent 20's answer is more comprehensive and portable in principle, but comes with two caveats:


*

*Any changes to AutomatorApplet.icns are lost whenever you modify and re-save the bundle in Automator.
Thus, for instance, you'd need a script to put the updated icons in place programmatically every time the bundle is saved.

*As others have noted, there are icon caching issues, which can be tricky to resolve; as of OSX 10.10.4:


*

*Even a reboot doesn't make the new icons appear in Finder (though it does appear in other contexts such as in the Dock), but there are two workarounds: either (a) move the bundle to a different folder, or (b) rename the bundle; given that reverting to the original path and name makes the problem reappear, you'd have to plan ahead: create your bundle in a different location or with a different name, then move / rename to the desired location / name.

*Alternatively, you can use a tool such as OnyX and check IconServicesunder Cleaning > User to clear the cache.




A: I found a hacky way to do it after you have created the applet


*

*(Create your icns icon file - however you want)

*Open Applications Folder

*Right-click on automator script

*Click on view package contents

*Add your icon to resources folder

*Rename it to AutomatorApplet.icns


I am sure there is a better way, but I figured out how to do it this way.

A: After the script has been created do the following :


*

*Find the source app with the icon you want

*Get Info of the source app (cmd-i)

*Click on the icon inside the source app's info window
(Not the one in the big Preview section at the bottom, if you have one of those; the little one in the top-left corner.)

*Copy it (cmd-c)

*Get Info of the automator script (i.e., the destination app) (cmd-i)

*Click on the icon inside the destination app's info window

*Paste the icon from the clipboard (cmd-v)
This method works for every files in Mac OS X.


A: Apple's official page on customizing files and folders works great for this! 
For the sake of completeness, for others who view this, I am sharing this.

Only drawback about this simple apple hidden feature: You can't undo the 'Restore original' icon by executting cmd + z from just made from inside Get Info... Or so it seemed.
Lucky me, I noticed that my custom icon wasn't completly removed in all the places (still present in the top side of the Get Info and in the Finder window miniature I both left opened).

If you want to replace the files in that case, and avoid failing, add with replacing at the end of line 18 (move every ... to cFolder with replacing).

If this is too SOish say so.

A: In the latest beta of XCode 4, there's a built-in support for Git, so it's possible to add other SCM.
Maybe Apple will also incorporate Mercurial"|"support as well.
They are several requests - XCode should support Mercurial as well as Git., Xcode 4 should support Mercurial - to put Mercurial support into XCode.
So if you can't find a solution now, I'd suggest you to wait until XCode 4 goes out officially.

By the way, if you need or want a nice Mac OS X client for Mercurial, you should try MacHg.

A: The lack of XCode plugins is due to the fact that apple doesn't document XCode's plugin interface in public. That makes writing XCode plugins very hard. To increase the chance for a future  Mercurial plugin you could file a dupe of Documentation and opening of the Xcode plug-in API (.xcplugin and family) which is dupe of rdar://3037631.

A: As far as I know, it’s not possible to add support for mercurial using Xcode alone. 
You have to use an external tool (Like Murky). Xcode’s SVN support is primitive to say something nice about it. It works, but it’s far from being like “Versions”. ;)

A: One may want to evaluate github for mac as an alternative.

A: You're not going to find an built in extension for adding other SCM's. Best bet is to either use another tool (Murky mentioned) or the CLI.
The third option would be to build a set of Xcode macros that performed common SCM tasks, such as commit and pull."|"Q: Is it possible to add alternate SCM options in Xcode 3?

How do I make iTunes not want to replace all of the apps and instead just make a backup of the existing ones?

*

*canceled"|"the sync

I just tested this out by alt clicking iTunes, creating a new library, and connecting my iPod.  It's pretty much exactly how I described.

*secondary click the iPod on the left

*click ""transfer purchases""


Afterwards, you can sync, and everything will be erased and rewritten to the iPod.
I'm not sure why Apple makes this so confusing.  The only reason I can come up with is that they want people to have to repurchase stuff but that seems a little over the top even from Apple.

A: When you plug your iPhone into your computer and sync it with iTunes, it will first copy purchased apps to iTunes (it shows this on the status window), then complete the sync.
I purchase apps on my iPhone/iPad all the time and don't worry about it, just plug in and sync.

I have a NetBoot image which I use for booting into to do things like disk maintenance and testing new applications without having to install them on my workstation. It's really handy, but I created it a while ago and much of the software on it is now out of date, like the OS, QuickTime, and Safari. I want to update the NetBoot image but the only way I think to do that is to use Disk Utility.app to|"restore it to a USB drive, boot from the drive directly, make any changes necessary and re-image the USB drive, overwriting the original image.
Is that the best series of steps or is there an easier way to update a NetBoot DMG file?

A: I think you've got the best way, I know you can mount the disk image inside the netboot image, but AFAIK it breaks the netboot; and some updates can't be applied to a non-boot-drive disk image. 
If you're netbooting a lot, I'd recommend using DeployStudio, a free, open-source powerhouse for network deployment and the like; it makes it a bit easier to update / deploy images than netboot - but it might be a but much for what you're using netboot for. 

A: I would suggest just using a separate user account if you want to test out applications without changing the environment you are working in, if your OS and everything else is up to date.
If that is not the route you are looking for, then I agree with glenstory that your direction is the Apple way to go, and will take more time, but maybe less time than learning DeployStudio which will let you update a netboot image, which Apple's System Image Utility will not.

588||"Q: Safari is using too much RAM. How can I reduce its memory footprint? I'm finding Safari (Latest - v5.0.2) to be even more of a memory hog than usual.  (Currently using 465mb of RAM with only this tab open, but having been running for a while)  
Closing it and reopening it lowers it's memory footprint, but it always creeps back up over time.
Aside from disabling extensions, any tips to help troubleshoot/reduce it's memory usage?  I've been using ClickToFlash which helps by requiring any Flash entity to be manually enabled on each page view.

A: This is just a fact of life using Safari. Spend some time browsing Flickr and it's memory usage will go way over a Gig. Gmail is another killer.
I think Safari most be doing aggressive in memory caching to speed things up.

A: There's nothing wrong with turning off flash, but the main advantage is lower processor usage, not just memory consumption (though it's great to see turning it off has lowered Safari's footprint). 
I don't think you need to worry about what Safari is doing with"|"memory for a couple of reasons:
Safari 5 is a 64bit application, where as Firefox and Google Chrome are only 32bit (at least the mac public releases). This is relevant because 64bit applications appear to use more memory while they're running (The Growl team explains this better than I could, here). 
If you've got free memory, which the OS (and Safari) can release quickly, safely and easily (speaking as a Programmer), why not use it to cache your web content - that's what it's there for. Trust your OS - it's clever, if another application needs the memory it'll just release the not-needed-right-now-bits-and-bobs. 
Safari also has an unfair advantage- it's made by the same company that built your computer. I'm not saying Safari is infallible, or even that it's the best browser, just that you shouldn't over-think the statistics; memory is there to be used and if it's not negatively affecting your computing experience then don't stress.  

A: using Safari 5.0.5, I have flash turned off and in running sunspider 0.91 I'm seeing real mem growth to over 1.73GB on a 4GB mac mini (2010), and CPU over 100%.  It runs so slow it doesn't complete in over 10 minutes.
Running the same in Firefox 5.0 (also 64bit) I'm getting 500mb of real memory 90% CPU, and it completes in less than 30 seconds (and is reporting 300ms as a score... spiffy!).
So my answer is... stop using safari on snow leopard and move to firefox 5.0.

A: So it appears that Flash is still the main culprit - if you enable any flash in ClickToFlash it stays resident in memory.
Following Gruber's advice on Daring Fireball, I've disabled Flash entirely on all browsers except Chrome and this seems to have helped immensely

A: You can disable cache in developer toolbar (right click-> inspect element), ""network"" tab, on the right side of the opened pane. When you hover the element it says ""Disable/Ignore cached ressource while loading resource"".
Once it is red, velvet cache are deactivated and memory consumption is far lower after that. 
You also have to empty the cache by activating developer mode, open menu ""developer"" -> ""empty cache"" and you will see a huge drop in RAM consumed by Safari.
There is also another major factor of performance drop : Virtual Memory (swap file). If a process start using it heavily (WindowServer), you will see a huge drop in computer performance because read/write access to disk is monopolized by these processes, leaving little room to other processes for disk access operations. 
I suspect Catalina to be buggy in that regard as I saw a huge drop in performance after updating due to excessive Virtual Memory usage, reaching as high as 250Mo/s of writing access and 200MB/s of reading access for a SSD.
You can try to disable Virtual Memory, if (and only if) you have enough RAM (>=16GB) with this command :
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist
If you run into issues after that, like sudden self-awareness making your mac unresponsive or excessive RAM usage, enable Virtual Memory again with :
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist"|"""its memory footprint""

I'm trying to determine if the actual LCD is broken or if it is ""just"" the graphics card, without taking out the screen and transfering it to another computer (which I intend to do if the screen is working).
I've tried connecting the computer to an external monitor, but, since there is no hard drive, nothing happens. The same nothing happens when I connect my working 12"" PowerBook to the external monitor.
Is there a secret keyboard combination that tells the PowerBook to throw some characters onto the screen (from BIOS or"|"something), and to mirror or output to the external monitor?

A: Given the two PowerBooks as described in the other questions, here's my 2¢:
Definitions

*

*PB1: the PowerBook without the hard drive

*PB2: the PowerBook without the SuperDrive

Steps

*

*Connect the external display to PB1

*Connect PB2 in Target Disk Mode to PB1

*Boot PB1

If everything works as it should, PB1 should boot and look just like PB2 (as it's booting with PB2's hard drive). At that point, you can run any necessary diagnostics.

A: No. Just get a small, cheap HD (even just a 20 GB will do fine here), put it in, and boot from a system installation disk as if you were going to install the OS.

A: You said you don’t have HD, but I assume you have the SuperDrive that used to come with those. Put the Jaguar/Panther/Tiger CD and boot from it, you should get output. 
You might also want to try resetting the PMU of the powerbook. Google or Apple Instructions Here.
EDIT: After reading some more about your problem in the comments, it’s clear now that you have 


*

*Powerbook #1: No HDD, Unknown Screen Status.  

*Powerbook #2 (Pro): Superdrive not working.


If the above is correct, your choices are:


*

*What Phillip said: get a cheap drive that boots any OS (Linux for PPC would do too) and see if your #1 boots with that USB drive and displays text. with this you cover your screen problem.

*Transfer the #2 Hard Drive to the #1 Machine and see if it boots from there.

*Try booting from #1 Machine that (if I am not mistaken, has a SuperDrive). 


Am I missing something?
And to clarify, there’s no Keyboard combination that will output text on a Macintosh PPC other than a verbose mode or similar, but that’s post initialization. There’s no BIOS or anything like that. (That I remember anyway).

A: I ran into the same annoyance myself, and stumbled into this workaround: 
Edit the ""Repeat"" setting for your alarm, and set it either to ""Every day"" or ""Never"". Now the alarm goes off when it should, unlike when it's set to e.g. ""Weekdays"".  Here's a screenshot — green works and red doesn't:

For more background info, I recommend these MacRumors articles:


*

*iOS 4.1 Daylight Saving Time Bug Strikes Europe

*Apple Support Acknowledges iOS 4.1 Daylight Saving Time Bug
The latter post contains Apple's recommended workaround (same thing as above, but with some additional information): 

To resolve this behavior for existing alarms, set the repeat interval to Never. You will need to reset these alarms for each day you need them.
After November 7th, 2010, you can set your alarms to repeat again.

It's now past November 7, and I just verified alarm works correctly again, even if repeat is set to e.g. ""Weekdays"". Which is nice. But I hope they fix the bug once and for all before the next DST shift occurs!"|"can try to set the alarm to ring at 6:30 am, but if you set the alarm to 6:30 it will ring at 7:30 instead.
I suggest you try to set the alarm to ring at 6:30 am, and then when it goes off, set it to ring at 6:30 again. If this doesn’t work, you can try to set the alarm to ring at a time that’s not an hour later than the time you want it to ring.

A: You have to take into account that the exact number is an approximated value and that the device needs additional space to install the application. I’m guessing that although the application says it’s 643Mb, it really uses some more when it gets installed. You’re really pushing the limits of your iOS there :)

     2. Quit Mail if it's running.
     3. In the Finder choose Home from the Go menu.
     4. Open the Library folder.
     5. Open the Preferences folder.

A: I have been asking the same question in other forums about resetting play counts"|"when syncing.
One of the strong theories is that it is an iTunes bug caused when you recreate your library in iTunes 10 from a previous iTunes 9 file (which is what I did).  Unfortunately though there is no obvious solution yet.
I have tried to solve to problem by installing a fresh copy of iTunes 9 on a separate PC and importing my existing library via the iTunes Music Library.xml file.
Unfortunately the trick for recreating the library by using the XML does not seem backwards compatible. Even if I modify the Application Version at the beginning of XML file it is not recognised by iTunes 9 and is overwritten by a new, clean iTunes Music Library.xml file.
It seems like a bug I'll have to live with until Apple fix the problem - I have submitted a bug report via their iTunes website.
Here is the thread from the apple.com forums - http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2697318
*edit*
The latest version of iTunes (10.1.2) seems to have fixed the play count reset bug.

A: These should really be seperate questions - one for the iTuensU, one for the track playdate.
As  for iTunesU issue, when you plug the iPod in there is a tab for iTunesU - you may need to check that the correct items are checked to sync.

A: For iTunes U: Make sure it's getting synced, (as Samuel said). Also, if they're videos, look for a Video Playlists section under Videos. That might let you play them from that playlist.
The reason you may have to do this: Apple wants to allow you to watch music videos/iTunes U videos without the video. This makes more sense for music videos: You get the song, and they video. You can  play the song without draining the battery from the video.

A: It's generally a good idea to run the latest version of iOS unless you're a jailbreaker.
To check out iTunesU content, go into the iPod or Music app and select ""More"" on the bottom right-hand corner. iTunes U should be in that list.

This"|"obviously has me pondering the quality of the latest range of Macbook Pro laptops, and I'm wondering how many of you may have had the same problems with your ones. Please share if you've had a similar issue.

A: I've had a number of Mac laptops, starting with a PowerBook 100 way back in the dark ages. I've been fortunate, I guess, that I've never had a stuck pixel.
You're fortunate that your retailer is working with you, as Apple considers a single stuck pixel to be within acceptable limits. That is, they don't promise zero stuck or dead pixels, so generally you'd just be out of luck. [Worth noting: ISO 13406-2, the standard for flat panel displays (more analysis here)].
If you find this happening again, though, you might try one or more of the (non-Windows) suggestions at How to Fix a Stuck Pixel on an LCD Monitor.

A: My experience in Mac tech support over the course of a few years has shown this be be fairly uncommon.  I only ever saw maybe two or three cases.  It may be an issue with the very specific range you're getting now, and which Apple will probably fix pretty soon.
Until then, keep sending them in- you've got Applecare for a year, so use it.  :)

A: My Macbook Pro had a malfunctioning backlight so they replaced the top assembly. The screen in the replacement had a couple stuck pixels in the middle of the screen, so they replaced it again. THAT screen had a stuck pixel in the bottom right, which after a couple weeks had changed to a horizontal line of them about an inch long. SOoo, back to Apple I went.
The screen I've got now has been perfect, with no bad pixels. I figure between the bench costs and replacement top assemblies they lost money on this machine, but once again Apple showed me they're a class act by not balking at fixing things. 

A: It doesn't surprise me that Apple would happily replace your computer, but for LCD screens (maybe LEDs too), it's not uncommon for companies to refuse to replace the screens if the dead pixels are a just a few."|"Q: How common are stuck or dead pixels on the MacBook Pro?

*sslscan - sslscan queries SSL services, such as HTTPS, in order to determine the ciphers that are supported

*watch - execute a program periodically, showing output fullscreen

*nmap - Network port scan to see what ports are open

*coreutils GNU coreutils. Includes gnu versions of basic unix commands, including ""color ls"" (gls) 

*pstree - Process tree listing 

*tcping - tcp

It is definitely possible to activate an iPhone 4 without a SIM card, but it is not a straightforward process and you will need some technical expertise and knowledge of Apple hardware and software. Here are the basic steps that you can follow:

1. Open the iPhone 4 box and remove the iPhone device.
2. Connect the iPhone 4 to your computer using the USB cable that came with the phone.
3. Copy the iPhone 4 firmware file to a blank USB flash drive or memory card. You will need the firmware file that came with the iPhone 4, which can be downloaded from Apple's website or from various online forums.
4. Insert the flash drive or memory card into the iPhone 4.
5. Power on the iPhone 4. It will take a few minutes to boot up.
6. Once the iPhone 4 is fully booted, go to the Settings app and select the Cellular option.
7. Tap the ""SIM Card"" button and choose the option to ""Use a Mobile Data Plan.""
8. Choose the ""No SIM Card"" option and tap ""Save.""
9. Go to the ""Apple ID"" section of the Settings app and enter your Apple ID credentials.
10. Open the App Store app and install the necessary apps and updates.
11. Once the iPhone 4 is fully activated, you can use it as normal.

It is important to note that this process is not completely risk-free and may result in data loss or permanent damage to the iPhone 4 device. It is therefore recommended to back up all important data before proceeding with the activation process. Additionally, it is highly recommended to have a good quality USB cable and a reliable computer for the activation process.

I personally rather just manually switch it on and off, until apple decides to have some kind of NFC. It should be just around the corner, if not with NFC, then with iBeacon.
Old answer (jailbreak only, iOS 4 or less)
First, I just tried on my iphone and even calculator stays active after 1 minute, even if the screen dims out. So maybe your question is really just about keeping the screen on.
Anyway, I can think of two solutions: kirikae with backgrounder might do the trick as a side effect. If not, you can use SBSettings with Autolock toggle to do it manually and temporarily set the auto-lock to never. All of them you should find in Cydia.
edit: as none of the above actually worked, here's some update.
Some custom toggles on SBSettings seem to just not work indeed. It's probably due to getting outdated or conflicting with something else, two common problems we find on cydia apps. BigBoss is kind of similar to SBSettings and also have an Autolock toggle. You could use it along with some multitasking, leave it on the background and use it as needed. It hardly have any conflicting issue.
Unfortunately I can't find many more ideas to this.
Only thing I can assure you is that I just tried SBSettings's Autolock toggle on my iOS 3.1.3 and it works. It also says it's updated to 4, so most likely it's either problem with 4.1 or conflicting with something else you've got installed. And believe me, there are conflicts from the least expected things (look at the comments).

A: I use iTunes.  As long as you have a song playing the screen will dim, but it won't go black and it won't lock.  If you don't want to have music playing you can download a track that's just silence, then put it on repeat.

EDIT: I should also note that the behavior described above only applies when the phone is on external power, that is, iTunes will not keep the phone unlocked when on battery power.

Compare text in Blocks, Fluid and Unified layouts in both Two-Way and Three-Way modes. Quickly navigate and search through the most readable diff you've ever seen.


A: Araxis Merge (http://www.araxis.com/merge_mac/index.html) is the gold standard in this area and has a similar cost (what is the weight of bits?).  There are Windows and Mac versions, and it is truly excellent if you find yourself spending a lot of time doing multiway diffs and merges (more common in these days of distributed version control systems).
The pricing starts (as of Sept 2011) at $129.

A: You can use FileMerge, Apple's diff solution. It's free and it comes with every Mac OS X install.
The only downside is that you have to install the Developer Tools. You can find them on your DVD install that came when you bought your Mac (Snow Leopard or earlier). You can also get the developer tools from the App Store if your version of the OS supports that.
Then, you can find it at /Developer/Applications/Utilities/FileMerge.app

A: Maybe you will find the app SourceTree interesting: http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ SourceTree is a free Mac client for Git and Mercurial version control systems. Therefor it isn't a general purpose diff or merge tool but it is worth mentioning it.

A: There's an application called SemanticMerge for Mac.
SemanticMerge, as the name says :-), is a tool able to merge based on code structure instead of blocks of text. It basically means it parses the code first and then merges based on methods, classes and so on, so it is quite refactor friendly since it can match methods/functions even when they've been moved to different locations within the file.
At the time of writing this, Semantic supports .NET, C, Java, C++ and JavaScript.

It presents file-diffs very nicely and handles three-way merges like a champ. As a long-time WinMerge user I was very happy with it. Its use of little gem-like icons in a 3-way merge takes some getting used to. One icon is for my change, one for their's, and one for the common ancestor. Once you get that straight it was very helpful.
* it was free, but may now be subject to Perforce's licensing. Perforce in-general is restricted to a certain number of users and/or files unless you buy it. However, these restrictions only make sense when using their server-side software. These client-only tools can't really be licensed like that. I'll update if I ever hear back from the company on this matter.

A: Agree with the recommendation for FileMerge.app.  You also have the free, cross-platform DiffMerge program, but I like FileMerge better.

Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers. Meld helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled projects. It provides two- and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has support for many popular version control systems.
Meld helps you review code changes and understand patches. It might even help you to figure out what is going on in that merge you keep avoiding.

I tried many contenders (Araxis, P4Merge and many others). I purchased several. I loved Changes for a long while. Now my favorite is Kaleidoscope. It provides 3-way merge, it can compare images in a smart way, it has a slick and elegant interface.
When an application claims to be cross-platform, that rings an alarm bell. More often than not, it means an ugly, non-native interface. Having to cringe when working is not my idea of having fun at work.

A: Meld is a good option..
steps to install meld on Mac :

I need to mount an SSH/SFTP volume and make it visible in finder to be able to use it as if it were a local volume (think SMB share).

A: As of March 2013, the current free software solution is macFUSE plus a package for SSHFS (a download link on Fuse for OS X webpage).
Macfusion is a GUI for easy mounting/unmounting remote shares but it needs to be patched to work with SSHFS/Fuse for OS X.

A: Well, MacFusion was going to be my answer but since you've"|"tried that I'll recommend my second favourite app when it comes to mounting shares: Panic's Transmit. It's new, very awesome, feature lets you mount any share that it can connect to in the UI as a ""disk"" in your Finder that you can drag files to. SFTP, SSH, S3...very cool.

A: The best solution I've found today (2017) is to use Homebrew and Cask to install osxfuse and sshfs. Note that Homebrew core deprecated all FUSE-related formulae in 2020 so you need to install sshfs from a tap:
brew install --cask macfuse
brew install gromgit/fuse/sshfs-mac

And then:
sshfs username@hostname:/remote/directory/path /local/mount/point -ovolname=NAME

It works! :-)

A: I use Cyberduck for this task. It's a cross-platform (but native on mac) app that is full of features and it's free to use. You can support the developers by donating or buying it directly from the Mac App Store.
The developer also has an application named Mountainduck which let you mount the path you want to a folder and access it through Finder app.

A: Best ones that you can use are Transmit, like has been said before, or Expandrive, which is probably more like what you're looking for, as finder integration is its main feature.

A: Another solution is WebDrive (35$+). I successfully used the Windows version of the same product, so I expect the same from the OS X version. Too bad, that they require you to buy separate licenses for Windows and OS X.

A: If you already have FUSE for OS X installed (e.g. you got it directly from SourceForge), then @eskatos solution can reduced to just installing sshfs instead of the whole cask which includes FUSE.  You can do this by using:  
brew install homebrew/fuse/sshfs

You might want to check if you have the latest version of FUSE for OS X through your System Preferences while you're at it.

A: Given I cannot comment, I'll add to this answer that if you want to unmount the recently mounted sshfs disk, you need to execute:
umount <MOUNTPOINT>

The sshfs man page states that you should do fusermount -u <MOUNTPOINT> but that command doesn't exist in macOS

A: Just in case you are having problems unmounting the disk, you can unmount it simply writing
umount ~/mounted/folder

617||"Q: What does it mean if I have lots of ""Inactive"" memory at the end of a work day? After a day's of work at my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.5, Activity Monitor shows that the majority of my computer's 8 GB of memory is ""Inactive"", and only a tiny sliver of the pie chart is ""Free"". This is even when I have closed all applications, with only the Finder running.
What does that mean? Is the ""Inactive"" memory taken up by something? Or is it actually still available for applications to use? Thanks.

A: This is most likely not a problem, and in fact is potentially speeding up your computer.
All (most?) operating systems utilise a Disk Cache, which stores some recently accessed files in memory so that repeated access of those files can be sped up. The disk cache on OS X is variable in size, and will appear as ""Inactive Memory"" being used.
If any program needs more memory, OS X will clear some of the disk cache (the least recently used files) to allow space for the program to run/expand.
I find that if I do a lot of compiling or photo-sorting (i.e. accessing thousands of files in succession) the disk cache will expand and use a lot of Inactive Memory. Provided its just this disk cache, its nothing to worry about.
If it is a background process or application that is expanding in its memory usage (but its pages are being marked inactive) then you'll be able to tell by checking for any programs with very high ""Real Memory"" usage in Activity Monitor. If there's nothing obviously large there (i.e. the total is a"|"long way short of 8GB) then it'll be the file cache.
You should see that there's little if any Swap usage, and if you open a memory-intensive program the amount of inactive memory will decrease without having to swap to disk.
(I believe there was a bug in 10.4 or 10.5 for a while where it wouldn't always free up this memory very effectively, and would cause swapping despite having a large disk cache, but in my experience this appears solved in 10.6).

A: ""Inactive"" memory is available for use by other programs -- it's just caching programs or data that you recently used, in case you need them again.  If you launch different programs or need different data, the cached memory will cleared and made available to your new workload as needed.
That's the theory, at any rate, and I believe it to be sound.  However, I did find this reference to a ""purge"" utility someone wrote because they didn't think inactive memory was being released quickly enough.
For official documentation on the subject, read this (and search for ""inactive"").

A: OS X, like most modern operating systems, uses a virtual memory system for managing memory. Among other purposes, this allows the operating system to treat the computer as having an unlimited pool of memory. To achieve this, the OS will page unused parts of RAM out to a disk store known as the swapfile.
Of course, RAM is not unlimited, so OS X groups RAM into four categories: wired, active, inactive, and free. Wired memory is required by the operating system, and can never be paged out of memory. Active memory is memory used by currently-running programs. Inactive memory was used recently by programs which have now been terminated (or haven't been unused in a long time). Free memory is, as the name suggests, RAM that is not being used.
When you launch a program, it gets loaded into active memory. When you quit a program, however, it doesn't get removed from RAM; rather, it gets bumped into inactive memory. This is why it is often faster to re-launch a program -- it is still in RAM (try this with a big program like Firefox).
Once all your memory is used (free memory is 0), the OS will write out inactive memory to the swapfile to make more room in active memory.
If a program gets paged out to the swapfile, and you re-launch it, it'll get pulled from the swapfile into active memory.
So in short, you actually shouldn't care if your free memory is low. In fact, you want it to be low -- free memory is wasted memory (as the OS isn't using it for anything).
When examining how much memory your computer is using, you actually want to pay attention mostly to Swap used, which tells you the size of the virtual memory swapfile, and Page ins, which tells you how often the OS has to pull memory from the swapfile into active memory.

A: Starting with OS X 10.5 there are evident memory management problems in MAC OS X. 
I finally managed to reproduce the problematic scenario, so i run the test and recorded the screen, into video.
MAC OS X Lion performance problem - broken memory management
I run the tar+bzip command, which is basic unix stuff, on the large amount of picture files, in my Pictures/ folder. Just before start, i run the ""purge"" command, to delete inactive/cached program data.
You can see on the video that free memory starts to drop very fast, and inactive is constantly rising. If you take a look at ""bsdtar"" command, it takes only a fragment of RAM, so the problem is not in this process. You cannot say that it is a program memory leak, because then the problem would not be in inactive ram, rather in active/wired.
When the free memory dropped below 100mb, i started some apps, like Safari, iPhoto and MS Word, and you can see in the video, that it takes even minutes to start an app, when normally (when there is free RAM), it would take some 3-5 secs to load.
I run the same scenario and the same commands on my Linux Centos 6 box, no problem there ! Memory usage is some 10-20mb, no problems with cache/buffer.
The memory management must be very broken in Mac OS X !

A: This discussion makes sense only if the statement that ""your computer will run faster when free memory is low"" - were true.  Unless my Desktop Mac is wired weird, the minute my free memory (monitored) starts getting low, whatever program I am running at the time starts to bog down to the point where I can't do anything until it moves back up by itself or by my Free Memory intervention.  I have an iMac 2118 (2006 or later) that maxes out at 3 GB RAM so I try to manage it when I can but this is very frustrating. Any thoughts?"|"Q: What does it mean if I have lots of ""Inactive"" memory at the end of a work day? After a day's of work at my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.5, Activity Monitor shows that the majority of my computer's 8 GB of memory is ""Inactive"", and only a tiny sliver of the pie chart is ""Free"". This is even when I have closed all applications, with only the Finder running.
What does that mean? Is the ""Inactive"" memory taken up by something? Or is it actually still available for applications to use? Thanks.

A: Inactive memory is likely being used by the operating system to speed up your computer. It is probably being used to cache recently accessed files so that repeated access of those files can be sped up. This is not a problem and is actually beneficial to your computer's performance.
If you are concerned about the amount of inactive memory being used, you can try closing background applications or other processes that may be using inactive memory. You can also try freeing up some inactive memory by clearing the disk cache, which will cause the operating system to remove some of the least recently used files from the cache.
If you are still concerned about the amount of inactive memory being used, you can try increasing the size of the disk cache, which will allow the operating system to store more recently accessed files in memory. You can do this by going to the ""System Preferences"" menu and selecting the ""Memory"" tab. There you can adjust the size of the disk cache.
Overall, the ""Inactive"" memory being used by your computer is most likely being used for a beneficial purpose, so you shouldn't worry about it too much. If you are still concerned, you can try freeing up some inactive memory or increasing the size of the disk cache, but these steps are not necessary."|0.37117600440979004|0.14902624894157496

on run {input, parameters}
    -- do shell script ""/usr/bin/find "" & input & "" -type f -name .DS_Store -delete -print""
    display alert ""Path: "" & input

The problem is, the path passed by the Service (in the variable input) looks like:

And for the command to execute properly, the path needs to look like:
Macintosh\ HD/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple\ Scripts/

So, is there a way to translate the first path to the second path? I was hoping for a core function which handles this. But I suppose some kind of regex/find/replace/etc would work? I'm familiar with HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP, not with Cocoa/AppleScript/C. Any direction or suggestions would be great!

A: Use quoted form of the POSIX path of input.  Without the quoted form of part, it won't handle funny characters (like spaces) in filenames correctly.  See this Apple technote.

A: Ok...this was easier than I had realized. After some Googling, it looks like what I need here is the POSIX path of command. This converts a given path to a Unix style path, which is the type of path you would see/use in Terminal. So:
POSIX path of input

Gives me a path like:
/Users/Matthew/Documents/Programming/Apple Scripts/

It seems to take into account that you just need a / at the beginning of the path, rather than the hard drive name. It does not, however, escape \ spaces (or handle special characters) in the path. So, as the other answer here mentions, you need to place the path in quotes ( "" or ' ) in order for those spaces (or special characters) to be interpreted literally. You accomplish this by using quoted form of. Here it is:

Do you have a friend with a Mac? If so, you could take the thumb drive & install DVD there and create a boot drive for"|"yourself.

A: This may not be the solution you want, but you could boot into single-user mode to run a diagnostic on your boot drive.
To do this you hold down Command+s when turning the computer on. You'll be dropped into a terminal.
Use the fsck utility (filesystem check) to examine the boot drive for repairs:
/sbin/fsck -fy

This forces the utility to check the filesystem and automatically repair errors it detects.
If it the resulting messages reads that the volume appears to be OK, then you've done all you can do from this method. If it reads that the filesystem was modified, run it again. Repeat running the command until you receive the message that the volume is OK, then reboot normally. You can do that just by typing
reboot

The newest version of CCC can tell you specifically what to copy, but basically you'll want the /System folder and a bunch of other Unix directories, and portions of /Library.
This CCC FAQ entry describes what specifically needs to be done to make a bootable clone, but basically you'll want to use CCC to copy:
/Library
/System
/bin
/etc
/mach_kernel
/private
/sbin
/tmp
/usr
/var

Be warned: if your boot drive is physically failing, cloning it like this might very well push it over the edge and kill it. Back up any important documents first. This is a somewhat risky method!"|"your Mac. If not, you could ask a friend or family member who does have a Mac, or look for a Mac computer at a local computer repair shop. 
You will need the following tools to create the bootable drive:

Any ideas are welcome.

A: iOS 5.0 and Mac OS X Lion have native support for Twitter integrated into the Address Book app. On OS X, to add a Twitter field to a contact, select the contact and choose the Card > Add Field > Twitter menu item.

A: You could add an URL to the Twitter home of your contact and label it Twitter.

A: Thanks to the comments on Ipacheco's answer, I ended using a new url labeled ""twitter"" with a format of ""tweetie:@someone"" instead of the http:// link to the twitter homepage. This opens up tweetie for Mac and iPhone (now named twitter) whenever you click the link.

A: modify your adressbook template as per this post:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/vanderwal/3629218638/
then add a little prefpane called MoreInternet as per this post:
http://www.macwrite.com/critical-mass/protocol-helpers-and-mac-os-x
use e.g. twitter: as ""protocol"" ... so for me you'd add twitter:@trox in a twitter URL field
configure the prefpane to recognize twitter as a protocol and tell it which app to use (your preferred twitter client -- works only if it has a ""creator code"", so I wasn't able to use TweetDeck :-o)

*

*I sync photos from various cameras (including iPhones) to iPhoto

*In iPhoto, I have setup a Smart Folder that has at least a Date filter of Last X Months where X is something you can specify depending on how far back in time you want to sync over to your iPhone



Once it is setup, iPhoto will show you the photos that match that filter



*Finally, in iTunes, you will connect your iPhone, select it in the iTunes window and using the tab bar at the top, select Photos. Turn on Sync Photos from iPhoto, select Selected albums, events and faces, and automatically include no events (note: include whatever events you want there, I include none). Then scroll down in the Albums list until you see the Smart Folder that you created in iPhoto and put a checkmark next to it.



Then the next time you sync your iPhone with iTunes, it should sync over all the photos in that Smart Folder. If it is too many, you can reduce the time frame that you pull photos from or use tags in iPhoto to mark some pictures to exclude and then include that information in your Smart Folder setup (telling that folder to exclude those tags).
If this is not the kind of information that helps you, then post some more info about the issues you are having so we can try to answer those specific issues directly.

If that doesn't work, try Resetting the SMC on an Intel based mac, or a PMU reset on an older PowerPC machine, then try again.
If that fails, you'll want to bring the machine into an  Authorized Service Center if it's under warranty, or look into less orthodox solutions if not.

A: I had a similar solution to TrentEllingsen.  My CD drive would not relinquish this stuck CD.  Not with a terminal command or eject button or what have you.
I eventually decided to go about it manually.  First I tried using a card to leverage the CD enough so that ""drutil eject"" would work but after several tries it was obvious it wouldn't.  So I rubbed on some elbow grease and grabbed another card.  I slid one under the CD and the other on top.  Then, like using a pair of card-nosed pliers, I pinched tight, pulled gently, and out came the CD... with protective slip attached!  That was the last time I let my girlfriend burn anything on my mac.

A: You could also use KeyRemap4MacBook, but it would make pressing return open items even in rename mode. And there are a lot of other places besides Finder where return renames items and other key combinations open them.

If you don't use a QWERTY keyboard layout, change KeyCode::O to KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN:

Karabiner was easier than the top answer here because you don't have to make a System Integrity Protection exception (El Cap).

A: For"|"anybody looking for this in 2018: use BetterTouchTool to make the Enter key simulate ⌘ Command + ↓ Down Arrow key press.

A: Any person new to Apple and Mac would find lot of things un-intuitive or just forced on the user, w/o any options to change it.
Or it might be that just many of us had their first experiences on Win/Linux systems.
But just found this plugin to finder XtraFinder which among lot of other options allows you to ENTER/RETURN to open a file.
Feeling a lot relieved now! Hope it helps.


A: As I know you can not set it to enter in a normal way (but maybe exist some tricky way) 
but you can change open shortcut by going to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard  Shortcuts tab  from the left window choose Application Shortcuts and press + to add new shortcut then find Finder in Application and choose Open in Menu Title and press any desired shortcut in textbox.


A: PresButan (Mac OS X 10.4.x-10.7.x): An idiotically named solution to a spectacular UI oversight (rather apropos, eh?).
It also lets you use either the backspace or delete key to delete files.
I can confirm it works (just installed it). Apparently it leverages the accessibility system and uses a daemon to catch the return events.
If you are on 10.3-10.5, you also have the option of using ReturnOpen.

A: In current 2022 Karabiner version,
go to ""Complex modification"" tab > ""Add rule"" button at the bottom >  ""Import more rules from the internet (open a web browser)"" button at the top 
Then you should find ""Application specific"" -> ""Finder"" section on the web-page and import it to your Karabiner.


Then use the same button ""Add rule"" to select rules you like from that group.

(Careful with using backspace, you can't backspace when renaming files)

I know it's possible to open a folder with ⌃ Command + ↓ Down Arrow but I don't like it and I never use it because it's easier to use the trackpad, but enter would be the easiest way.
I tried to set it trough the keyboard shortcuts but I can't do it.

A: I know this is an old question, but I wanted to share a solution that I found to work well for me. I'm using a Macbook Pro with macOS High Sierra.
I used Karabiner to create a custom keyboard shortcut for opening a folder in Finder when the return key is pressed. I created a simple .keymap file and added the following line:


<item>
 <name>Open Folder with Return Key</name>
 <identifier>com.apple.Finder</identifier>
 <key>F10</key>
 <keycode>53</keycode>
 <modifier>COMMAND</modifier>
</item>


Then I opened Karabiner and chose ""Allow Input"" from the menu. I also added the .keymap file to the list of allowed input sources. Finally, I relaunched Finder. Now when I press the return key, Finder opens a new window displaying the contents of the selected folder.

A: MMFix hasn't been updated for Mountain Lion yet, but I did find this solution to work, run 

launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist

in the Terminal.

A: iTunesPatch did the trick for me on OS X Yosemite.
Description from website:

The application will patch the Remote Control Daemon to prevent it from starting iTunes whenever you press the play button on the keyboard or an external remote control. This will only prevent iTunes from starting, all other functions (like play/pause while iTunes is running) will continue to work as before. The original file is backed up in case you would like to restore the original functionality."|"MMFix is a free patch for iTunes that stops iTunes from launching when you press the play/pause button on your computer.

 + 1, 2, 3 ... 9 launches the first, second etc App in task bar.
Is there a similar keyboard shortcut in OS X in order to launch Apps that are in the Dock?

A: I don't know the exact solution but you can use control+fn+F3 after that you can navigate through Dock with keyboard arrow keys (→ or ←) and press enter on your desire app.

A: Just downloaded a 99 cent app from the"|"mac app store called ""Snap"" that fixes this. Now I hit command-1 and the first app in my dock launches. Awesome!

A: As @Am1rr3zA said, you can use the default Control + fn + F3. You can then press Enter or Space to launch an app.
You can change the key binding in the Keyboard shortcuts menu in the Settings application.


A: This is a neat windows feature to want in the Dock, but if you like keyboard shortcuts, why not get a customizable application, like Quicksilver that lets you do a lot via the keyboard. Its not going to be easy / quick if you have a lot of Apps in your dock to remember a meaning less position number of a icon in a dock, when you could just ask for what you want directly.  Something like Quicksilver will not only help you open stuff in the dock faster it will let you open stuff not in the dock at extreme speeds.
For example, after getting Quicksilver's attention via a configurable key command, I type ""F"" and hit enter to open Firefox on my setup.  

A: Create a Hammerspoon script to assign shortcut keys. For example, this script assigns Option+C to Calendar and Option+M to Mail.
shortcuts = {
    {""C"", ""Calendar""},
    {""M"", ""Mail""},
}

for i,shortcut in ipairs(shortcuts) do

I followed the standard procedure and my contacts were wiped out on my iPhone so I am scared about backing them up.

A: Connect your iPhone to your computer. Open iTunes and select your iPhone in the sidebar on the left. Select the Info tab and choose from one of the available options based on your operating system.

A: I sync mine with my google id

A: iTunes can create backups of your contacts, photos, videos, text messages, notes, etc. of your iOS device when you:
* Sync with iTunes"|"(disabled if you have iCloud backup turned on)
* Right-click (or Control-click) the iOS device in iTunes under Devices and choose Back Up

How to back up and restore from a backup
http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1766

A: In recent firmwares, you can use every Exchange-Provider (including Gmail) for over-the-air-sync of contacts, mails etc. 
I use this feature to sync my contacts with my Gmail account, but you can use that as a backup too.

A: What procedure did you follow exactly? Note that the normal process for contacts is to sync the iPhone with the ""Address Book"" application. During the Sync iTunes also makes a backup, which can be used if you accidentally wipe the phone.
You can also tell iTunes to replace the information on the phone with what is on your Mac, which defaults to the Address Book's contacts. If you did a replace and there weren't any contacts in Address Book, then you could get what you saw.
Does any of that make sense?

A: Sync your phone with iTunes. Done.

A: When you connect to iTunes with USB cable, iTunes backups your contacts. Also you may chose gmail or win address book to backup or sync in itunes.

A: Personally I use MobileMe (now iCloud), but iTunes works just fine. 

A: Alternatively (or as an extra precaution on top of the iTunes backup), you can sync with MobileMe. If you don't have it, sign-up for the trial. Then your data is safely in the cloud and on your computer.

A: You can also use iSync (find it with your Spotlight bar) which can do much more than just syncing contacts.

A: There's an app called Phone Disk that seems to do exactly what you need. The one downside is that it needs to be installed on the host computer to work.

A: Sure, take a look at the iOS app Air Sharing. It makes a storage area accessible over Wi-Fi via WebDAV. It also allows you to view the contents of some file types on the device itself (for as far as there are built-in viewers).
Alternatively, you can jailbreak and store files directly in the iPhone's memory. Use SCP over WiFi, or connect the USB and use iPhoneBrowser.

Restore, but not from a backup. One less-than-ideal fix for this issue
  involves restoring the iPhone as a new
  device rather than from a backup. It
  appears that bad holdover data from
  iPhone backups can cause loss of data
  access. Restoring as a new phone will
  delete contacts and other data, but
  generally resolves this problem.
To do so, connect your iPhone or iPod
  touch to your computer, click
  “Restore” in iTunes, then choose
  “setup as new phone.”


A: Try a stock (un-jailbroken) ipsw file from scratch. Use this procedure to downgrade properly.
I think that when you restore using your jailbroken image, you're just putting the problem back onto to the device. I've noticed that even after a brick, when I restore with redsn0w, it's not a clean install, as my previous applications and settings are still there. I think a fresh install of stock firmware may help. Jailbreak it only after you find out if original firmware works.

I heard that Apple's Time Capsule has short-living time, so I thought that there exists alternate way.
I would be glad to see any recommendations and success stories.

A: I have an external hard disk connected to an AirPort Extreme. Time"|"Machine wirelessly backs up my MacBook Pro to it. In this regard, it works the same as TimeCapsule but as the hard disk is external (and you get to choose it), it doesn't suffer from the same reliability problems.
I've found the AirPort Extreme to be a very good Wireless Access Point, too (and not just for Apple devices).

A: Get an external hard drive at least the size of your internal hard drive and just use Time Machine. It doesn't get any easier than that.

A: While it's not automatic my solution has worked well for me.
I purchased an external USB drive larger than my MBP hard drive.

When the backup is complete SuperDuper puts the computer to sleep.

That gives me a complete, boot-able backup off site.

Plug your iPhone into a variety of
  computers, yours or other people's,
  and you'll find that your phone and
  iTunes want to wipe everything clean
  and start over, every single time.
  Andrew Grant at the Shiny Things blog
  shows how to edit your iTunes Music
  Library XML file to sync your phone
  (or iPod touch) with different
  systems. That means you can, say,
  auto-grab just your music from your
  Mac at home, but grab Contacts and
  Calendars from your work PC. The guide
  requires very little hacking, and
  Grant provides links to simple text
  and hex editors to get the job done.

When I drag them to the sidebar in finder they can't be renamed.
When I mounted them using ""connect to server"" they get mounted under /Volumes.
Alternatively I can access them using /net/host/export and they will get automatically mounted.
But there doesn't seem to be any way to visit a /net/host/export directory using the finder GUI.  Although it seems I can use ""open"" from the command line to visit it and then drag it to the side bar.
So anyway.   Any ""best practices"" out there?

I seem to have a choice to drag either /net paths to the side bar or to drag /Volume paths to the side bar.  The finder seems to implement the auto-mount"|"functionality when I click on /Volume-based sidebar links.
I could also create symlinks to /net paths and use those symlinks.
One of the core problems I have is that the /net paths (and the /Volume paths) are long and unfriendly.  I'm looking for a way to ""manage"" these in a way that lets me use shortcuts or aliases of some kind.

I'm still collecting tips.  When I get more, I'll come back here and rewrite this.
Basically /net paths are treated by the finder as local directories.  In some ways it treats them as local (must use 'Goto' to open them) and in some ways it knows they are special (they don't show up in the ""Mac HD"" location).
If you have any other tips, please add them.

A: In Finder press: 


*

*⇧+⌘+G to go to a directory. Since the automounting of /net is handled by the operating system (via Autofs, see the technical white paper) it will mount the share.

*⌘+K to open the Connections window, where you can even save your commonly accessed locations.
(see the Go menu)
But I don't think you can rename connections.

A: You can mount any NFS share using the fstab file (http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html). I found it to be the best alternative for mounting share so they appear in the top level of Finder (and also available in the sidebar), a feat impossible using autofs. Most importantly, it gives you the ability to add mount options like nolocks and rsize/wsize, which usually increase performance. YMMV.

A: Here is what I did with all network shares I use:


*

*Mounted all of them using Finder Go menu item ""Connect to Server"".

*Set checkbox ""Connected servers"" under Finder's Preferences General
tab. That makes all that shares appear on my Desktop.

*Created a folder ""Network"" inside my user folder (on the same level
as Documents, Movies, etc.

*Dragged all of the network shares from my Desktop inside that
folder.

*Dragged that ""Network"" folder on Finders Sidebar and also dragged it
into my Dock.


Now I have easy and quick access to all my network shares and they mount automatically. And I also renamed them to my taste to better reflect what they are about. Is that the thing you want to accomplish ?
Tips:


*

*One can have several such ""Network"" folders like Home and Work.

*One can create and put there Screen sharing and Remote Desktop
shortcuts as well.

*One can change their default ""remote volume"" icons to better
differentiate them.

*One can create new network aliases by dragging items from ""Remote Volumes"" section (Finder>Go>Computer.)"|"Q: Does anyone have any tips or best practices for using NFS mounted directories? Does anyone have tips for conveniently dealing with a variety of NFS mounted directories in Mac OS X?

The blue circle in google maps looks to be about 2 miles in diameter, and never shrinks to a pinpoint.  Apps like RunKeeper can never get a strong enough GPS signal.

*Giving the phone a prelonged stern look


Any ideas greatly appreciated.

A: The prelonged stern look didn't work??? Lol 
I see that you tried restoring from a backup. Try restoring to stock software instead of your saved backup and see how it works. I've noticed that sometimes erratic behavior is caused by corrupted files within the actual backup image.
If that doesn't work, try taking it in for service...I really don't think that's necessary though.
Hope this helps!

A: It sounds like the receiver chip is malfunctioning. If your 3G is still under warranty, return it to the store for service!
Something similar happened to my 3G: it would no longer find any Bluetooth devices, and no wifi networks even when I entered the network settings manually. I tried hard for weeks to make this work again, even restoring/upgrading etc. but in the end it turned out that the radio chip had died... After a long and phoneless week, I received a brand new replacement 3G from the store.

A: Bear in mind that A-GPS is by no means less precise than GPS. The A(ssisted) technology consists of the phone using the Radio (phone) network to query about the Satellites’ information, the GPS receiver only has to care for the “time” information from each satellite, instead of the full pack of information (which is usually lost in poor reception areas like cities anyway). So, A-GPS, by combining info coming from the Cell antenna about the Satellites, and squeezing what it can from the real GPSs messages, can pinpoint your more or less accurate location. In a perfect world, you’d have 6 or more satellites telling you all the information…
If you’re not getting a good location, then I suggest you do what has been suggested, try a fresh “install” (you can later try to restore) or take the phone for service, the GPS Receiver may be failing. 
Apart from the cell radio to obtain the info, the iPhone also uses wi-fi (if available)."|"Q: iPhone 3G GPS is unreliable; seems to use assisted-gps only A few months ago the GPS in my 3G has become really unreliable.

656||"Q: Which Macbook Pro Hi-Res screen is better for editing photos? The Apple shop lists glossy and antiglare options for their Hi-Res screens and I'm not sure what the difference is, and in particular which one is better for editing photos.

A: This is 80% what calavera already said, and I'm only posting it for a few additional details that wouldn't fit into a comment. Translation: Accept calavera's answer instead, if you're thinking about accepting mine.
Glossy is generally considered"|"better for accurate color gamut (I believe that's the proper term). Closer to ""real life"", full representation, etc. If you're professionally serious, I would still recommend picking up a color calibration kit, but you'll likely have less tweaking to do for accurate representation.
Anti-glare is exactly what it says, and exactly as calavera put it, it doesn't reflect the sun, room lights, generally light sources nearly as strongly, so you can use it nearly anywhere without having to re-orient/re-angle yourself. But, as a side effect of this, colors are dulled, a bit washed out.
Photo editing, video editing, anything that is geared for visual presentation pretty much demands a glossy screen, as opposed to something with just a visual interface (surfing, audio editing). Of course, with Apple making the anti-glare the ""special order"", it's there for people who need it, but otherwise people get the better choice in the majority of situations, by default.

A: In my experience I would have to say the glossy.  Even though the resolutions are the same, I really think that the glossy has much better color reproductions and looks more natural.  The anti-glare tends to dull the colors, making it more difficult to judge when making adjustments.  In fact, both my wife and I went with the glossy earlier this year for exactly this reason (photo editing).  She has a lot more experience with photoshop than I, and she was blown away by the difference in color between the two."|to be better for editing photos, as it has a lower reflection and is more resistant to fingerprints.

My plan is someone coming from US can bring to one to India. Is this possible to do?

A: Yes, it is possible to jailbreak an iPhone for use in India. You can either buy an unlocked iPhone from a retailer, or you can jailbreak your existing iPhone. Jailbreaking is a process that modifies the operating system to allow you to run apps and install new software that are otherwise restricted by Apple.

Once you have a jailbroken iPhone, you can use it with a local carrier in India. You can also use it with a virtual SIM card, such as Google Voice or T-Mobile’s international plan. This will allow you to make and receive calls and use data services in India without having to purchase a local iPhone plan.

It is important to note that jailbreaking your iPhone may violate Apple’s terms of service, and there are potential risks involved. It’s recommended that you backup your iPhone and have a current backup before you begin the jailbreaking process.

If you decide to purchase a new iPhone for use in India, you can either buy it unlocked or you can ask the seller to unlock it for you. Unlocked iPhones can be purchased from third-party retailers or online sellers, and they are often cheaper than official Apple products. You can also ask the seller to unlock your iPhone for you, but be aware that this may void your warranty.

Once you have an iPhone that is either unlocked or unlocked by the seller, you can use it with a local carrier in India. You can also use it with a virtual SIM card.

It’s important to note that using an iPhone in India without a local plan can be very expensive. The cost of data plans in India is relatively low, but the cost of calling and texting can be high. If you plan to use your iPhone for voice and text, you should consider purchasing a local plan.

Finally, it’s important to be aware of the potential risks involved in using an iPhone in India. There are frequent power outages in India, and the network infrastructure can be unreliable. It’s also important to be aware of the local laws and customs in India, as they may differ from those in the United States."|0.39143985509872437|0.14362657091561937

Via piquadrat answering my similar question on gadgets.stackexchange.com.

A: Canon made a utility for their printers called Easy-PhotoPrint.
Otherwise, they are more generic utility like ePrint (but it's far more perfect or convenient).

A: I have used the iPad part of PrintCentral with mixed results - I have a HP Color LaserJet 2605dn connected to an Apple Airport router. The printer is configured as 'A4' (I'm in the UK) and while some things print just fine from the iPad, other things seem to have pagination issues. Printing from emails and Safari generally seems okay.
To be fair I think that the only way you're going to get this to work seamlessly is if you can find a wifi printer with drivers for the iPad (do they even exist) - everything else is likely to be some kind of compromise.
EDIT: Just to be clear, PrintCentral can either print directly to the 'network' printer, or can send data to an app on your Mac/PC. I haven't tried the latter approach (and your question says you don't want to do it that way anyway) - but I have used it to connect and directly print to my HP from the iPad.

A: Have you tried Google Cloud Print? https://www.google.com/cloudprint/learn/apps.html

A: The answer depends on what kind of printer you have.
The fundamental problem is printer drivers. That is why all of the apps use a server/proxy on a desktop computer, that way the can piggyback the desktops existing printer drivers. Otherwise they would need to include drivers for all supported printers.
A few of the printer vendors have iPhone/iPad apps that can take to their network printers, but obviously those only support their printers (an usually only recent ones).
I expect this to change at some point in the future (when Apple builds printing support into iOS), but this how things stand with iOS 3.2/4.0."|I can't tell what the exact question is, but I can tell you that Epson iPrint is an app that lets you print from your iPad to an Epson printer.|0.3849759101867676|0.07

I have a bunch of This American Life podcasts that I downloaded using iTunes on another computer.  I also have a This American Life podcast subscription on my current Mac with a bunch of podcasts downloaded.  
I have already imported the old ones into iTunes.  They show up as two separate podcasts, with the same name and metadata.  The old ones have a ""subscribe"" link but I haven't clicked it, they're just sitting there.  The new ones are subscribed and regularly downloading new episodes.
How can I merge the old ones into the newer,"|"subscribed version of the podcast in iTunes?

A: This has been bugging me for years, most specifically with This American Life and To The Best of Our Knowledge.
The tag that's causing them to be separated is not available via iTunes -- you need an extended tag editor. On the Mac, I used ID3 Editor. 
Instructions specifically for ID3 editor:
• Open a ""good"" podcast file (you can drag it straight from iTunes onto the ID3 Editor icon in the dock to open). 
• Click on the Podcast tab. Look for the field called Feed (It may have a different name if you're using different tag editing software). Copy the Feed field contents.
• Open your ""bad"" podcast files, paste/replace the ""good"" Feed info into the Feed field (they should be different - mine were) and click Update.
• Last important step is that you have to delete the ""bad"" files from iTunes and reimport them. If you right click or control click the file in iTunes before deleting, and select ""Show in Finder,"" the enclosing folder will open. If you sort by date modified, all the podcast you just updated should be at the top, if they're in the same folder. Then you can delete all the bad ones, and drag them back into iTunes. Whey they're re-imported, they should now be grouped with the ""good"" podcast.

A: Select 'em all, and go to File-> Get Info. If any usual fields are blank, this means that they vary among the selected tracks. If it should be the same, type in the right value.
This procedure almost always fixes this kind of a problem.

A: Follow-up on what Nathan G. said: sometimes, it helped me when I checked fields that were filled in to overwrite these values, so not only the empty fields, but title and album as well (probably all fields but title would be fine).
Also, as a last resort, all metadata for each podcast are written in /Users/YOUR_USER_ID/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml.

Question: Is there a way to"|"hack the system (or install a plugin?) so that it by default copy/move operations merge the source and destinations instead of outright wiping out the destination and everything inside (with no option for recovery)?

A: EDIT: Based on your clarification, you're looking to merge two directories. See this question for more information. There's no built-in way to do that using the OS X Finder.
As an alternative, you could try using standard unix tools like rsync, which are available via the command line. But this is not a very ""Mac like"" solution.

I'm not sure what you're asking, because when you copy a folder from one place to the other, nothing is deleted at all. I assume you're talking about copying a folder from one location to another where a folder of the same name already exists at the destination? If so, The Mac OS X Finder will show you a warning, it won't delete anything without your permission.

OUTDATED ANSWER
I haven’t seen that option in the Apple Developer Program, but you can reserve a name. 
After you reserve it, you have 120 days to upload a binary (You have to create an app in the iTunes Connect system). After 90 days, you receive a notification from Apple, saying that you  only have 30 days left to upload the app. Once the 120 days are past, ""the app name will then be available for another developer to use.”
I also believe that if you do not upload anything, bad things happen to your account, but I can’t verify this.
Other than that, I haven’t seen a mechanism like “google” for name searching. (Apple might as well do that at some point!).

669||"Q: Apple 30"" Monitor Intermitently Flashes Off and On I have an apple 30"" monitor plugged into my late 2008 15"" Macbook Pro. Every once in a while when I start up the Macbook pro the monitor will first turn on, then off and repeat indefinitely until I unplug the DVI connection. If I place a finger on the power touch switch on the side the monitor, the display will usually stay on as long as I hold my finger there.
Has anyone else had this problem. Anyone know what causes it or if it can be easily fixed.
The monitor is not under any kind of warranty at this point.

A: 
I don't know why, but if you unplug the monitor power"|"(not just press the power off switch) and then plug it back in the problem goes away.
My guess is that the on/off switch on the side of the monitor is heat sensitive and calibrated for the temperature of the room, if the room temperature changes, things become un-calibrated, and the monitor starts thinking it's receiving a touch even when it's not. 
The stan marsh method resets this calibration.

A: I have a similar problem with my 2009 15"" Unibody MBP, intermittently. 
It seemed to be to do with the mini-DVI to DVI connector. My laptop goes everywhere with me and is invariably plugged into other things whenever I arrive anywhere, so over time the ports start to get a bit 'soft'. I found that if the mini-DVI to DVI connector wasn't completely sat in the dvi-out socket properly, then the display it was plugged into would flicker. 
I have 2 'identical' Apple mini-DVI to DVI connectors, and one of them seems much more prone to being a 'loose fit' than the other one.
Can you borrow another mini-DVI to DVI connector to try it?
Your heat theory is an interesting one but I doubt that the calibration is that sensitive (I've got an older Cinema Display model with the touch-sensitive brightness and power controls, and I've never known it turn itself off/on regardless of the temperature of my office, which varies wildly throughout the year). I could be wrong, though! :-)

A: I also found that @Ben's answer worked for me, but it help kept happening more and more often. Eventually I called Apple because the monitor was still under warranty and Apple replaced the monitor--just the monitor, not the power supply so it seems that @Ben's right on what the problem is.

I found the application http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/, but it only allows one to split the screen horizontally.

A: Here is a decent workaround streamlined from the hints in the comments to this question. In this example I use the PDF viewer Skim, but it should work the same with any other app.

Open Apple's Script Editor that is in the Applications/Utilities folder, and copy the following code.

    tell application ""Skim"" to activate
end open

Save it as an application. Now every time you drag a PDF into the icon, a new instance of Skim will open. I like to use OSX's native split-full-screen view.

To use this, copy the script, open the the Script Editor application under /Applications/AppleScript/, and paste into a new script. I am going to guess that click menu item ""Printer name"" will have to be changed as I don't think the menu item really says ""Printer name"", I'm guessing it says something like ""HP OfficeJet 6500"". Make sure that all menu names match.
Save the script as either an application, which can be launched from the dock, or a script, which can be run from the AppleScript menu bar item.

A: ""The Unarchiver"" is a great tool, and I highly recommend it, both the GUI and the CLI tools.
That said, my unzip command is
ditto -xk foo.zip target_dir

where 'target_dir' is the directory where I want the files to appear (and it can be '.' if you want them to unzip right there). 
Note that 'target_dir' will be created if needed.

Converting to JPG changes the file format in ways that make it a lot less flexible. I have my own photography company, and only shoot RAW when I'm doing serious work, because I need the flexibility of non-jpeg. I convert to Photoshop format and do all my manipulation in their format, then save a copy of the final image in Adobe's Photoshop format, then make another copy and save it as JPG, ready for sending to the place that does my prints. RAW and TIFF support better color and greater gamut (light range from dark to light) and you can see the difference after converting to jpeg so I want to avoid the conversion until the last step.

A: Converting to something that isn't RAW means you'll lose data. GIMP and Photoshop are essentially raster image editors so you lose that very useful camera data.
Silkypix is another good alternative for RAW editing and conversion and it supports a huge list of cameras. It is a non-destructive editor so any editing you do leaves the original file unharmed."|RAW files to JPG. You could try to use that software to convert the RAW files to JPG and then import the JPGs into iPhoto.|0.42641520500183105|0.09459459459459461
681||"Q: How can I move my local e-mail folders in Mail.app from my old Mac to my new Mac? Including all e-mail messages contained in these local folders ofcourse.

A: Under ~/Library/Mail/ you should have a folder named after you mail account. Inside it, there are .ewsmbox files that contain all your e-mail folders.
Try to move those from your old to your new Mac.

A: *

*Click the ""Finder"" icon on the dock to launch a new Finder

*Navigate to your account's Library folder in Mac OS X's Finder. Under Places, click your username (the one with the house icon) and then click ""Library."" You can also do this by selecting ""Go"" from the Finder's top menu and then ""Go to"|"Folder."" Type in ""~/Library"" (without the quotes), and it will open up the Library folder.

*Find the ""Mail"" folder.

*Copy the entire ""Mail"" folder onto a storage device (USB thumb drive or blank CD-R) or transfer it over the network to the same place (User:Library) on the other Macintosh computer.

*Go to the Preferences folder in the Library and locate the ""com.apple.mail.plist"" file. You can navigate there using the Finder window or select ""Go"" from the top menu of the Finder, click on ""Go to Folder"" and type in ""~/Library/Preferences/"" (without the quotes) in the prompt.

*Copy the ""com.apple.mail.plist"" file onto your USB thumb drive or CD-R or copy it directly to the User:Library:Preferences folder on the other computer over the network. ""User"" is your user account name.c

*Plug in the USB thumb drive or insert the CD-R into the optical drive on the other Macintosh computer if you haven't transferred the files over the network.

*Move the ""com.apple.mail.plist"" file to the User:Library:Preferences folder of the other Mac. ""User"" is your user account name.

*Move the Mail folder to the User:Library folder on the other Mac.

*Launch Mail.app. Now your settings and email should be the same as those  on the old Mac. If not, make sure both  the Mail folder and the  ""com.apple.mail.plist"" file are in the  correct places.


A: In Yosemite, open the local mail app, go to file>import mailboxes, then in the import pane that comes up, navigate to the user folder where the email app from the other computer is(stashed on a thumb drive or if you can connect directly to the other computer).

Not immediately thus I see I can save the French language preference, but then I receive the next mail in German, I check my account and language is set to German.

A: I have experienced inconsistencies at times in the"|"language used in communication received from Apple. I am not sure there is a clear answer. While a single Apple Id may be used to authenticate separate systems (e.g. Developer, iTunes, MobileMe) may handle languages differently.
From my experience, the following appear to affect the language used in communication from Apple.


*

*The language of the device that
initiated an interaction using an
Apple Id

*The language of the
country for which you are registered 

*The language in the preferred
language setting


For example, when purchasing from iTunes on my iPhone (Spanish), I received a receipt in Spanish. But when ordering from my Mac (English) I received a receipt in English.
To isolate the problem it may be worth reviewing which systems you use with Apple and in which languages to see what may be causing the change. If you are near an Apple Store, with this information, they may be able to help you sort our what is causing the change. Or perhaps report it as a bug in there system. 

A: From the Apple support forum:
https://discussions.apple.com/message/26685508#26685508
Go to appleid.apple.com, click ""Manage your Apple ID"" and log on.

683||Q: Does upgrading iOS change my IMEI? Does upgrading iOS change my IMEI? I was told not by AT&T not to remove my SIM card or certain restrictions that they had placed on the iPhone, at my request, would be lifted. I want to know if upgrading my iOS is like removing the SIM card. I think this was because the|"IMEI number changes when the SIM card is removed from the phone.
Does upgrading iOS change this number?

A: The IMEI is kind of like a MAC address for the cellular network only. It is nearly impossible to change it, you can only spoof it on a software level. So the answer is, No, your IMEI will never change unless you really really want it to. Removing the SIM card shouldn't change the IMEI either...

A: The IMEI shouldn’t change when you upgrade the phone, at least here in Europe. Mine is still the same. 
Update: Upon some reading around, it turns out that if you “hack” your phone, (maybe in the past), an update would change some IMEIs, and AT&T would therefore invalidate the SIM. Be careful with what you do :)

A: No, upgrading the OS doesnt change the IMEI by default, there are hacks available to do it, but its illegal and hence, not recommended. 

A: No. Upgrading iOS won't change the IMEI of your iPhone."|iPhone was reported stolen. IMEI is the International Mobile Equipment Identity.

685||"Q: How do I connect to a SOCKS Proxy from an iPhone/iPod Touch? I like to surf securely and privately via a SOCKS proxy which I created via SSH tunneling, on the Mac. I used the SSH client on my Mac to achieve this. Then I thought, since the iPhone OS is essentially Mac OS, the same trick might work also on the iPhone.
I managed to create a SSh tunnel on my iPhone via the Terminal (iPhone's Terminal). (Yes, it's jail-broken)
ssh -D [port] user@domain.com

At this stage my iPhone is SOCKS proxy.
However, there doesn't seem to be a way in the iPhone networking preference panel to specify a SOCKS proxy. Someone suggest creating a Proxy Auto-Contig (PAC) file to workaround this, but that sounds complicated.
Any ideas how to make iPhone use it's own SOCKS proxy?

A: Wow thanks for that last answer. 
Together with this ""SSH to get your iPhone online via USB cable"" blog post, I came up with a pretty solid instant reverse SSH/SOCKS solution over USB tether given only an SSH server somewhere on your network. This allows all my tcp-based apps to use an SSH server's internet across USB despite my WiFi being defective and not having a strong phone data plan (T-Mobile Prepaid). 
No proxy server configuration required.
The gist of the blog post is that you CAN control the proxy from the command line. Use the file:
/private/var/preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist
Find the ""ip1"" section (if you want to replace GPRS/EDGE/3G interface) like:
<dict>
<key>Interface</key>
<dict>
<key>DeviceName</key>
<string>ip1</string>
<key>Hardware</key>
<string>com.apple.CommCenter</string>
<key>Type</key>
<string>com.apple.CommCenter</string>
</dict>

Be careful that you got the ip1 section if you want to override EDGE/3G! Do not look for the other Proxies entries in the file.
Then add the following section afterwards:"|"<key>Proxies</key>
<dict>
<key>ProxyAutoConfigEnable</key>
<integer>1</integer>
<key>ProxyAutoConfigURLString</key>
<string>file:///private/var/preferences/proxy.pac</string>
</dict>

Then use your trick to specify an SOCKS proxy in the file we just specified:
/private/var/preferences/proxy.pac
Add:
function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{ 
     return ""SOCKS 127.0.0.1:1080"";
}

Change permissions on proxy.pac to 777 (all can read, write, execute).
Reboot the iPhone.
Download iTunnel for iTunes 9 (older versions are available too). (http://www.mediafire.com/?2q1fzowoy12)
Create a new Putty Connection: in Connection>SSH>Tunnels section add new forwarded ""remote"" port, like port 202 on the iPhone to your internet-facing SSH server (say, 192.168.2.100:22).
Source Port: 202
Destination: 192.168.2.100:22

In the SSH section of the same Putty Connection set your Remote Commmand to:
ssh -D 1080 user@127.0.0.1 -p 202

Save your Putty configuration to a new named session.
Optionally generate keys & add the public keys to *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* to both ends so you don't need to type passwords. Use putty.exe -load ""Profile Name"" in a shortcut to speed it up even more.

A: Well I guess, there's no better way to do it.  Darn you Apple, is it so hard to put a SOCKS Proxy setting in the iPhone OS network settings panel? 
:-(
Anyway, the best answer so far, and the only one I could find on the Net, is from a document from the SNIPPLR Code 2.0 website entitled How To Connect To A SOCKS Proxy From An Unjailbroken iPhone/iPod Touch. 
Below is a cleaned up version of their solution:

Let's say, perhaps, that you are already forwarding your web traffic through an SSH/SOCKS tunnel at work (for privacy reasons) and you would like to use that same tunnel on your iPhone/iPod Touch. This is actually pretty easy to accomplish.



*

*Make sure the SOCKS tunnel on your work computer allows LAN connections so your iPhone/iPod Touch can connect to it. 
ssh -N -g -D 1080 user@domain.com


*Create a text file and insert the following code:
function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{ 
     return ""SOCKS 192.168.xx.xx:yyyy"";
}

Replace the x's with your IP and the y's with the port you used after the -D in your SSH command

*Save the text file as a Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) file to a web accessible place with a .pac extension. 
If you're reading this chances are you know how to serve a file over HTTP on your work LAN, so I won't delve into that.

*Finally, on your iPhone/iPod Touch, go to Settings → Wi-Fi and click the blue arrow to the right of your work network. Scroll to the bottom, click Auto and type in the address to your PAC file (e.g. http://192.168.xx.xx/mysupersecretproxy.pac).
Now you can surf the web securely from your iPhone/iPod touch.

A: This message seems to suggest that it's not possible to do this via the command line, if I'm interpreting it correctly. I think that means you really can't at all, since the Network preferences don't support SOCKS.

A: iPhone + SSH Tunnel + Socks Proxy = SUCCESS Very Happy
--> http://thireus.dareyourmind.net/index.php/thireus-home-news/8-general-announcement/109-iphone-ssh-tunnel-socks-proxy-success-d
Thanks for the help :)
I'm now able to use my local socks proxy via Wifi/3G/Edge :p and I also created a script that recreate the tunnel if the connexion has been lost ;)

A: If you have access to the shell (jailbroken) and can place the proxy.pac file in the location mentioned above, you can also use the following link for the proxy.pac file in the Network preferences for the connection you are trying to tunnel:
file://private/var/preferences/proxy.pac

Together with an SSH tunnel to an SSH server in the US, I can listen to Pandora/Slacker etc. over  Wi-Fi outside of the allowed coverage area (i.e. while traveling outside of US).

A: The answers above are not all right.


*

*The ssh -D is not a global proxy on iOS system (such as iPhone and iPad).

*The HTTP proxy is also not a global proxy.
They cannot both be used on most games and IM (instant message). It just for some web surfing (Safari is all right) but mostly only this.
The best and most easy way on iPhone and iPad is using VPN. That's global agent, which can transfer all Internet data via remote VPN server. Another choice is OpenVPN, which gives a client on iOS. 
There is no such a program for iPhone and iPad to run global socks proxy like that on Windows.

A: I found a way to do this without jailbreaking, but you will need access to an ssh server, which you could host on your own home computer.
You will need two iPhone applications; iSSH (ssh tunnel), and ProxyBrowse (socks5 browser).
You will also need an SSH server.
For this example we'll call our SSH server [host] and our user account for the ssh server [user].

SSH Server
Run the following command: 
SSH -f -N -D 8080 [user]@[host]

That's right, you're on [host] creating a dynamic port forward back to [host], you'll see why soon.

iSSH
""Add Configuration..."", fill out the usual stuff for the server/username/etc. Near the bottom you can choose SSH > None, and you'll see an option for ""Tunnel"", select that. Choose the button to ""Add Tunnel"".
Localport: 8080
Dest Host: [host]
Dest Port: 8080
Save everything and open the connection.

ProxyBrowse
Server: localhost
Port: 8080
Don't fill in Username or Password, you won't need to, because iSSH already created the tunnel and iSSH continues to run in the background on your iPhone.
That's it, now you can browse the web over an SSH tunnel.

Want to go a step further? Install Tor on your server, have the iSSH tunnel connect to the Tor port, and then from your phone you can truly browse the web anonymously.
For the technically inclined who want a little more detail on what just happened:
[host] : ssh -f -N -D 8080 [host]
[client_tunnel] : ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 [host]
[client_socks5] : localhost:8080

The SOCKS proxy browser communicates over the local port forwarding tunnel to the dynamic port forwarding tunnel on the server.

686||"Q: How well does VirtualBox perform when compared to VMWare Fusion for Linux guests? I'm looking to do some Linux development, which includes some live testing of my application. I need pretty decent performance, but maybe not pedal to the metal performance, at least not for testing. However, I don't want a VM that is going to drag me down, or use more of my Mac's resources than needed. How well does VirtualBox perform on Snow Leopard?

A: Having extensively used VMware Fusion (all the versions from 1 beta till 3.1), Parallels (from their first public release till 5.x -haven’t yet upgraded to 6) and a lot of"|"VirtualBox versions (Although I stopped using it six months ago), I can say that for Windows both Parallels and VMware ran circles around VirtualBox in terms of features, compatibility and speed. 
I used to compile .NET code inside those Windows and the speed of VMware and Parallels was superior (I went ahead and clocked different timings).
VirtualBox’s advantage was (and still is) price. For a lot of stuff VirtualBox is enough, but it’s still (as far as I understand) slower than its two (only) competitors. 
The advantage you have is that VirtualBox is free, so you can start trying it now, and both VMware and Parallels offer trial versions you can try. If you’re serious about finding the best virtualization solution for your scenario, I suggest you take the appropriate time to test all three options yourself. 
I’m personally using Parallels 5 these months, because it worked better than VMware 3.1 for my Visual Studio C# very big solution. However, I’ve used VMware and skipped Parallels 3 and 4 because they were more unstable and slow (for me). 
I didn’t want to upgrade to Parallels 6 because they annoy me with their $49 upgrade price that you have to pay every year. 

A: I cannot compare to VMWare, but VirtualBox and Linux work just fine on my laptop. I run computationally expensive code on the Linux VM. It only has 1 CPU whereas the laptop is Core 2 Duo. The laptop has 8GB RAM and the VM gets 2 of those.
One slight performance improvement is to boot the VM headlessly, then ssh in, if your application isn't a GUI.

A: I run Ubuntu Desktop 10.10 as a guest in VirtualBox Mac, and can say that it runs about as fast as when I ran it in Fusion. It is definitely slower that in Fusion for things that open a lot of files (such as recompiling the kernel), but in the same range for normal desktop Linux use, at least in my case."|"VirtualBox on Snow Leopard is a bit of a mixed bag. It is the most complete and mature of the three products in terms of feature set, but it is also the one that is most likely to have regressions and bugs.

On the other hand, VMware Fusion and Parallels Desktop are more focused on providing a good user experience and are less likely to have regressions or bugs. However, they might not have as many features as VirtualBox.

In terms of performance, all three products are quite good. They are all able to provide good performance for most use cases. However, if you are doing heavy processing in your virtual machine, then you might want to choose a product that is more focused on performance, such as VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop. If you are mostly doing light processing or web-based work, then VirtualBox should be fine.

In terms of resource usage, all three products are quite good. They are all able to use a reasonable amount of resources, and they are all able to provide good performance even on older hardware. However, if you are looking for the most performance possible, then you might want to choose a product that is more focused on performance, such as VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop.

Overall, all three products are quite good, and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them really depends on your specific needs and preferences."|0.397996187210083|0.12991452991452992

A: As of"|"iTunes 12, you cannot watch a movie while it is downloading. This is a pretty recent change, but has been proven and is 100% reproducible.

How can I get the search result exactly for 'C#' or 'C++' in Preview?

I've tested it and"|"found it was able to find C++ (without needing any quotes/special options) without bringing up all C results.
It was also able to search specifically for accented characters (like é or ö) — though requires such characters to be accented in the search to find them (i.e. you can't search for blah and expect it to match bläh, nor vice versa). In Preview, either search will return matches for both accented and unaccented characters.

A: Enclose the search string in double quotes, as such: ""C++"". This will filter the search results from the search for ""C"" so select Relevance as your sorting criterion from the gray toolbar that appears. All the pages with occurrences of ""C++"" will then be presented first.

A: You could just open the PDF in Safari. Safari has a more standard approach to searching PDFs -- it looks for exactly what you type. Preview used to behave this way, but somewhere around OS X 10.5, Apple tried to make it smarter, e.g., looking for pages that contain some or all of the words you type, instead of treating your words as a phrase. This new behavior in Preview is much less useful to me, but I don't know any way to turn it off. You can partly get around it by putting quotes around phrases, but I haven't found any way to get Preview to search for symbols, e.g., ""C++"".

If needed, there are more details on this Apple help page: Sharing your Internet connection.

That means that I can't launch Safari or Mail or other apps, which is the only thing I use Spotlight for. Only restarting helps to resolve this.
Is there a way to force Spotlight to reindex the Application folder?

A: This happens whenever I erase the free space on my hard drive (probably for"|"the same reason -- that process creates a big file that eats up all the free space, then overwrites it, creating a low space condition in the process).  Typing this command at the terminal:

sudo mdutil -i on /Volumes/Hard_Disk_Name_Goes_Here

will rebuild your index. Substitute your own disk's volume name in the obvious place.

A: Another alternative is to just have Spotlight delete it's index which will cause it to create a new one:
sudo mdutil -E /

If that fails to work, toggling Spotlight on the drive in question will work:
sudo mdutil -i off /
sudo mdutil -i on /

Change / to the path to the external hard drive if appropriate.

A: You could drag your application folder to the “Privacy” tab and a few moments later remove it, that ought to cause a reindexing. Maybe unchecking it and re-checking “Applications” also does the same, but I’m not sure about the later. 
If any attempt to do that fails, you might want to create a fresh index following these instructions. That usually clears any spotlight problems.
Also, running so low in disk space is never a good idea, try to make some room for the sake of your OS stability. That is also the reason why restarting fixes it, because when you restart, temp stuff gets deleted and there’s more “room” to play with in your HDD. As you start using your drive, the free space is less, and services start to fail."|"Q: Spotlight loses index of Applications When I get warnings that my HD is nearly full (Macbook Air, 64GB SSD), spotlight always loses its index of applications. That means that I can't launch Safari or Mail or other apps, which is the only thing I use Spotlight for. Only restarting helps to resolve this.
Is there a way to force Spotlight to reindex the Application folder?

A: Spotlight is a very useful feature of macOS, but it can be frustrating when it loses its index of the Applications folder. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to troubleshoot this issue and get Spotlight working again.

First, it’s important to make sure that Spotlight is actually indexing the Applications folder. To check this, open the Spotlight search field and type “applications” to see if the Applications folder appears in the results. If it does, then Spotlight is currently indexing the Applications folder. If it doesn’t, then Spotlight probably isn’t indexing the Applications folder, and you’ll need to take steps to fix this.

If Spotlight is not indexing the Applications folder, then the most common cause is that the Applications folder is located in a different part of your hard drive than the Spotlight index. To fix this, you can move the Applications folder to the same location as the Spotlight index, or you can create a new index for the Applications folder and then move it back to its original location.

To move the Applications folder to the same location as the Spotlight index, open the Finder app and navigate to the Applications folder. Then, create a new folder at the same location as the Spotlight index (for example, ~/Public/Spotlight-V100) and move the Applications folder into this new folder. After this, restart Spotlight and it should now be able to find the Applications folder.

If you want to create a new Spotlight index for the Applications folder, open the Spotlight search field and type “create index” to open the Indexing Options dialog. Then, click the + button to add a new index, select the Applications folder, and click OK. Restart Spotlight and it should now be able to find the Applications folder.

If you’re still having trouble with Spotlight, you can also try resetting its preferences. To do this, open the Spotlight preferences dialog by going to the Spotlight menu and clicking “Preferences”. Then, click the “Maintenance” tab and click the “Reset” button to reset Spotlight’s preferences.

Finally, if none of these solutions work, you may need to contact Apple support for further assistance."|0.38644057512283325|0.1581259150805271

I've tried managing by hand which apps sync on which device, but this information gets lost periodically, which means a huge app dump across the iPad and iPhone 4.

699||"Q: Permissions for new files in shared directory We just got a new iMac are using the /Users/Shared directory to store media assets (pictures, audio, video) that we want accessible to all users on the machine. After copying over all the files initially, we set the desired permissions and then applied the same permissions to all directory contents recursively. This is working fine, except then whenever someone creates a new file or directory, it does not have the same permissions and we have to repeat the whole permissions process before everyone can access it.
Is there a way that we can set permissions for all new files/directories created within that directory?

A: Another approach is to use Terminal (a.k.a shell or command prompt) to create/edit (must be performed as super-user, see sudo) the file: /etc/launchd-user.conf adding the line:
umask 000
save and reboot. New files/folders (including files changed by save as) will allow everyone read/write.
This works by changing the default file creation permissions for programs, whereas the ACL approach works in terms of access rules bound to particular files and folders.
Without this tweak, files are created allowing user: read-write, group & other: read-only.
If you are sharing between"|"multiple computers, you need to do this for all computers that will use the share.
If you have existing files and folder in the shared area, you need to make them all readable/writable by everyone using:
sudo chmod -R og+w <shared-folder-name>
The command reads in English as change mode, recursive through all sub folders and files, other & group permissions add write access, starting at folder with .
This approach is mentioned in forums to work with at least as early as 10.6 and still works on 10.7.
Other factors still affect access to content. For example, permissions set in the Sharing control panel, home folder permissions/ACLs, and when using Terminal any umask in effect for the shell.
Look up umask and Posix file permissions for details on these Unix concepts. In the write ups, the word directory is Unix parlance synonymous with folder. You will also encounter the terms UID and GID: user and group IDs, which define the Posix ownership of running programs (processes). Note that UIDs and GIDs are numbers which may be the same or different for a given user name across different computers. These numbers are assigned to names in the order accounts are created on a given computer, typically starting with ID 501. Home networks lack a mechanism to harmonize these assignments across computers. Therefore on network shares a file may appear to belong to different users because the user ID to user name binding is determined from the perspective of computer is accessing the file. So shares really always allows everyone to access files to various degrees of everyone. In other words, the Posix ""other"" permission is an indefinite limit on access ranging from allowing a quite predictable but apparently uncertain degree of access depending on the user IDs assigned on different computers. This leads to apparently absurd variations in experiences, where on some networks, for example a setup with only one user account ever created on each Mac, will be able to share without any permissions tweaks because all accounts will have the same UID (501, no matter what the accounts are named) whereas another network using multiple user accounts per Mac will see problems right away. So some groups will never struggle with this, whereas some others may see problems that develop over time, or problems which appear/disappear spontaneously, depending on when/how additional user accounts are created/used with the shared folder. 
It's a mystery why Apple has left such a festering usability defect in the configuration of such an otherwise easy to enable file sharing capability.
On external disks, this problem is addressed with the ""Ignore permissions on this volume"" option. There may be a similar feature for apple file sharing, but where is it.
If you roll you own Samba service config there are other mechanisms for handling these problems, but Samba is not at all easy to use.

A: You can't do this with traditional POSIX-style permissions, but you can with inheritable access control entries.  To allow read+write access for the entire ""staff"" group to everything in /Users/Shared/reallyshared, you'd use:
sudo chmod -R +a ""staff allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit"" /Users/Shared/reallyshared

The file_inherit,directory_inherit part means that this access control entry will automatically be added to new files & folders created inside this folder, but it doesn't automatically apply to items already there (that's why I added the -R flag to chmod -- that applies it to everything currently within the folder), and it won't be applied to items created somewhere else and then moved into this folder (I don't know of a way around this, sorry)."|multiple users, you may want to create a group for the shared files and set the permissions to allow all members of that group to read/write.|0.3421957492828369|0.051593323216995446

In iOS, when you tap and hold down an image, an action sheet displays asking if you want to save the image, copy to the clipboard, etc. But what if you just want the URL?
If safari doesn't offer this functionality, is there a 3rd party browser that"|"does? Specifically, one that works on the iPad.

A: Neither iOS Safari nor Opera Mini support this option. However, you can install the 'view source' iOS bookmarklet, as explained here:


*

*http://fettig.net/weblog/2007/07/02/view-source-for-safari-on-iphone/
And use it to look for the image link within the source you are visiting.
This may be cumbersome using older iOS versions, but it is much easier on iOS 4.2, using the 'Find text on webpages' feature which allows you to search for text using Safari's Search field (right of the navigation bar) to look for image extensons like .jpg, .png and .gif.

A: Tap, and hold the image; then choose ""copy,"" open a new browser window, and paste into the address bar.

A: Tap and hold, and the 2nd option will be to open it in a new page.  Tap that, and you'll get a new window.  Tap the URL bar, and Copy.

A: [Note: this has only been tested on iOS 5.1.1 on iPad]
For a simple image, you can tap-and-hold it and select 'Copy'. This will copy the URL of the image which you can paste wherever you need it.
However, when the image is being used as a link to another URL, this method copies the linked URL only.

It works pretty well, except for one huge problem: if it determines that I haven't been listening to podcasts for a while it stops downloading them. Is there any way to force iTunes to continue downloading podcasts regardless of how often I listen to them? For most it isn't a big deal, but there are some (like ""This American Life"") that only publish one episode at a time so it's impossible to"|"download the ones that you've missed.
This would also be useful to set up an iTunes server that shares the podcasts over the local network - since the podcasts would be listened to remotely, their ""new"" status would not be changed.
I poked around com.apple.iTunes.plist to no avail - if there is a setting to disable it, it's not labelled in there.
One idea I had would be possibly trying to fool iTunes into thinking that the podcast was listened to recently, as one of the criteria for automatically unsubscribing is that it hasn't been listened to in 5 days. Would it be possible to periodically set this value to the current time? Or might it even accept a future time so it doesn't have to be periodically set?

A: Apple covers this feature in their Making a Podcast page.

Automatic Unsubscribe.
iTunes automatically unsubscribes from
  a podcast if the following conditions
  are both met:
  
  
*
  
*The user has not played any episode downloaded in the past 5 updates
  (there may be more than one episode
  downloaded per update.
  
*More than 5 days have elapsed since an episode was played.
  
  
  In addition to minimizing unnecessary
  bandwidth costs for both the user and
  the podcaster, the unsubscribe logic
  built into the iTunes client makes it
  more likely that episode downloads, as
  reported by a podcaster to a sponsor,
  are roughly in line with actual plays
  of the episode

And as far as I am aware, you cannot disable this feature.

A: There is an Applescript called ""Update Expired Podcasts"" at dougscripts.com.

Civilization IV is a turn-based game in which the player builds an empire from very limited initial resources. All standard full-length games begin in 4000 BC with a settler who builds a single city. From there, the player expands an empire while contending with rival nations, using the geography, developing infrastructure, and encouraging scientific and cultural progress. By default, players can win the game by accomplishing one of five goals: conquering all other civilizations, controlling a supermajority of the world's land and population, being the first to land a sleeper ship in the Alpha Centauri star system, increasing the Culture ratings of three different cities to ""legendary"" levels, or by being declared ""World Leader"" by winning a popularity election through the United Nations. If the game's clock runs out (by default in the year 2050 AD) with none of these goals fulfilled by any nation, the nation with the highest score is declared the winner.

A: Freespace 2

The game continues on the story from Descent: FreeSpace, once again thrusting the player into the role of a pilot fighting against the mysterious aliens, the Shivans. While defending the human race and its alien Vasudan allies, the player also gets involved in putting down a rebellion of those elements of Vasudan (Hammer of Light) and Human (Neo Terran Front) forces which don't want to cooperate with one another.

*You can switch to using Skim, or another PDF previewer that supports the behavior you seek.

*You can ""open file.pdf"" to refresh and bring Preview to the foreground, and then another command to bring your editor or terminal in front of it (open file.pdf; open -a Terminal.app).


A: If you want to use Applescript to bring Preview to the front, then all you need is this line:
tell application ""Preview"" to activate

You could also use the osascript command in the command line to run that script as well. There are specific things to look out for (escaping quotes and handling multiple lines).

Currently the iPad doesn't support printing out of the box, however I have heard there are several third-party solutions on the market, each with a mixed bag of results.
Which solutions are available and which is the most versatile or successful?

A: Apple has indicated printing will be available with the iOS 4.2 release, currently scheduled for November 2010.

A: I've looked at this issue before for my parents.  Apparently there are many solutions"|"that do part of the full range of (document types, printers) well.  
My suggestion is this: http://mobile.eurosmartz.com/prod_index.html#comparison
I'm trying out PrintBureau. Wish they had a demo version so I could test before buying.

A: Print n share is an app I use on my iPad. I don't have an AirPrint enabled printer, but with this app, I can print via the weprint server on my Mac from the iPad. I would definitely recommend taking a look at this app. luck

A: My wife and I have been using Printopia for a while now and it works perfectly for us. I have it installed on my computer and anyone with any iOS device can see it when they choose print in iOS. They then choose our HP 1022n which is connected to our AirPort Extreme base station and that's it, printing.
http://www.ecamm.com/mac/printopia/
We print from two iPad (3), an iPhone 4 and a 4S, and our friends have a variety of iOS devices of different vintages (and OS versions) and they too can print on our network.

A: I would recommend Fingerprint 2 from Collobos Software. From the developers site:

FingerPrint automatically discovers all printers connected to your Mac
  or PC and makes them available to your iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.
  For a fraction of the cost of a new printer, FingerPrint breathes new
  life into the printers you already own.

The basic premise of the software is that you install it on a PC or MAC and it acts as a simple print server proxy to provide any access to any printers connected to your computer. It offers work flow integration and security (ACL's). You must be on a WiFi connection to be able to print. I use this software daily and it ""just works"". It's not an inexpensive solution ($19.95) but for the money it is incredibly simple to setup and will have your printing in under 5 minutes.
Developers site: Collobos Software"|"available, but they vary in terms of their convenience, compatibility, and features. The most popular solutions seem to be AirPrint and Google Cloud Print. AirPrint is a built-in solution that allows you to print from your iPad to any HP printer that supports AirPrint. However, not all HP printers support AirPrint, and even if your printer does support AirPrint, you may need to update your printer's firmware to enable this feature. Google Cloud Print is a web-based solution that allows you to print from your iPad to any printer that accepts Google Cloud Print. Google Cloud Print works by sending your document to a Google server, which then sends the print job to your printer. Google Cloud Print is available now, and it works with any printer that accepts Internet-based print jobs.

Now if someone could figure out how to cross the impossible chasm to somehow connect into the BBM network, it would be a game changer.

A: Kik Messenger is relatively new and has the best feature from BBM (IMO);
Sent, Delivery, Read and typing status for messages
Unfortunately it was pulled from Blackberry's App World and actually blocked from pushing data on the Blackberry due to the fact that the founder was once an intern on the RIM BBM team.  RIM is actually in the process of suing Kik - which just goes to show you that they are onto something.
Even without proper support on Blackberry, it's highly recommended for iPhone, and there is an Android version as well.

A: iMessage (Free)
iMessage, Apple's own messaging platform, can send and receive messages on iOS (5 or later on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch), macOS and watchOS, as long as they are connected to either a Wi-Fi or cellular network (3G). Starting with iOS 10, Messages includes support for third party apps.

I'm currently recording videos of my screen using QuckTime Player and a MacBook Pro 13"" (mid-2010) in a resolution of 640x480. The application I'm recording is called Synthesia (it is a game like Guitar Hero for piano) and is based on OpenGL.
Somehow all videos I record do have a subtile stuttering which I think is annoying (see an example here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEBAKQ4-Zcg).
Is there a program that will do a better job at recording my screen than QuckTime Player, or is it just my MacBook Pro that is not powerful"|"enough?

A: The reason for the “stuttering” could be a combination of different factors.
First is of course your computer’s power and video card. The more power you have, the more the number of FPSs your computer can “record”. 
Despite that, QuickTime is not known for its “fast” recording, so I suggest you give a try to different alternatives. This comparison is a little bit “outdated” because some (if not most) of the applications mentioned have been updated and have fixed or changed some of the problems they had, however, it should be a starting point for your final QUickTime Replacement. This other link has a very similar list, but rather than a review is a list with a short description of the products.
For reference, the most important Screen Capture tools for OS X (or to put it in another way, the “most used ones”) are (in no particular order): iShowU, Snapz Pro X, ScreenFlow and one that is missing from those lists (because it’s a new player in the Mac world): Camtasia for Mac (which I’ve been betatesting and it’s quite good and in par with the ones I’ve mentioned). Some features missing from Camtasia 1.0 have been addressed in an update and I know they are working on a newer version after getting tons of feedback in the Beta forums (which I can’t disclose because I participated).
I’ve personally tried those four I’ve mentioned (i have a Snapz Pro license) and I think they more or less are the same, but some were (when I tried them) faster than others but lacked certain features. All in all, the “best” doesn’t exist, they all have strengths and weaknesses so your best bet is to give them a try and see if one does the job.
Last but not least, remember that quality also plays an important factor in CPU overhead when recording, try to keep your CPU load low and reduce the recording quality as much as you can afford."|enough to record the screen of an OpenGL application without stuttering?|0.4231085181236267|0.03399433427762039

I know that on Mac OS X, you can take a screen capture of the entire screen with Command+Shift+3 and you can take a screen capture of just a selection (or a window) with Command+Shift+4. Is there a rationale for this keyboard combination? What is the history of that command? Where does Command+Shift number originate from?

A: 
What’s an FKEY?
FKEY’s (Function Keys) are resources containing executable code that are called upon by hitting the keys Command-Shift-# (any number 0-9) at the same time. In the standard System file there are two FKEY’s; with an ID#3 and #4 that are used to dump the current screen or window onto disk or printer.1


So far as I can remember/find, screenshot commands were first added to the OS"|"itself in System 6.2

1 Text and image from FKEY that runs other FKEYs!   by John Holder (MacTech magazine, 1988)
2 Further reading/references: Mel's Macintosh Universe: Macintosh Plus and a forum posting from 2003, How do I take a screen shot (the latter of which features some guy named Chealion).

A: Dori's answer was correct, but I figured I'd add just a little more history. Early Mac Keyboards did not contact Function Keys (F1 through F12 etc). In place of Function Keys, they allowed the user to type Command+Shift+1 through Command+Shift+9.
Prior to Mac OS X, the system software contained a ""Suitcase"" called ""System"". This was the heart of Mac OS classic, and contained the code necessary to boot and run the machine. However this code was not located in the data fork of the file, it was located in the proprietary Mac OS Resource Fork which is set up like a database -- every resource has a type, which is a four byte value, and an ID.
Prior to Mac OS 9, all application code was in resources of type CODE. In the system suitcase, there was a special resource of type FKEY. These were essentially just CODE resources, with the exception that FKEY resources 0 - 9 would be executed when the corresponding Command+Shift+number key was pressed.
If I recall correctly, the Command+Shift+1 FKEY ejected the floppy and the Command+Shift+2 FKEY ejected the floppy in the second drive (external or of a two-floppy Mac (e.g. some SE/30s)). But there were software developers out there who made FKEYs. I remember as a kid having all the open FKEY ""slots"" filled. One let me draw freehand on the screen (my love for freehand circles started early :-) and one put the Mystery Science Theater 3000 characters at the bottom of my screen.

A: Apple Technical Note OS01, dated ""Mar 01 1985"", describes the mechanism of command-shift-1 through command-shift-4.  Originally, 3 took a screenshot to disk, and 4 sent a screenshot directly to the printer.
They didn't all use FKEY.  1 and 2 were processed by GetNextEvent, but captured by the system.  3 and 4 used the FKEY defined in the System file.  5 through 9 were available for the user, via FKEY.  0 doesn't seem to have been supported.
According to Wikipedia's table of release dates, this technote was written just before System 2.0 was released.  They also claim (without reference) that System 2 introduced this shortcut for screenshots.

I saw this question regarding copy utilities for OS X, however the answers were skewed towards speed.  My concern is ultimately file/data integrity.

A: rsync has proven to be very stable and effective throughout its years of Unix service. It’s included in any OS X since Tiger and it’s relatively easy to use. 
If you want the bonus of a GUI, you can use Arrsync, a free utility better described as: 

A Mac OS X graphical front end for the utility rsync.

If, on the other hand you want something more “easy to use” I can recommend you take a look at the two winners:
SuperDuper! ($)
Carbon Copy Cloner (Free, Donationware).

*When unmounted, it returns to the size of the contents and is again password protected.


Is this possible with disk images (DMGs)? What is the best way to set this up?

A: This is exactly what a dmg does.
To create one use Disk Utility and hit the New Image icon. Then choose the size, encryption and choose the image format as one of the sparse images. Even if you choose a large size it will only take up space according to what you save in it.

A: You can not write to a disk image where the format is compressed

… files in and out …

The compressed formats do not allow addition, edition or removal. 
You can use existing files to create an image with a compressed format. Write once. 
If you create a new blank disk image that is compressed — with or without encryption — it will be relatively useless: 


Compressed — write once. The one write occurs when you create the image — not afterwards. The resulting volume is read only: 

You can use Disk Utility to convert a compressed image to a format that allows writing.

A: You can use TinkerTool to change the default system fonts and increase their size.


A: Sorry I forgot to mention earlier, I've also tried tinker tool. While it does increase the font size for most mac apps it doesn't allow customizing other apps (such as the adobe suite that I tend to use day in day out).

There seems to be no easy way to customize the colors, and googling only showed weird workarounds involving SIMBL and forcing the terminal to 32-Bit.
Is that still the case, or is there a way to change the colors in Snow Leopard's Terminal.app? My shell is zsh, not bash if that makes a difference.

I have found a 64-Bit"|"compatible SIMBL/TerminalColours plugin, but if I can avoid having to use SIMBL, that would be my goal. I know that there are alternative terminals like iTerm, but I want Terminal.app.

A: As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, the sixteen ANSI colors are customizable in Terminal preferences.

Terminal > Preferences > Settings > [profile] > Text > ANSI Colors


When you point at one of the color controls it displays the ANSI color name and number for reference.
When you edit an ANSI color there's a button in the color panel for resetting the individual ANSI color back to its default:

A couple of tips about the Settings preference panel:


*

*As with most of the Settings, you can select more than one profile at a time (e.g., Shift- or Command-Click, or choose Edit > Select All) and change the colors for all of them at the same time.

*The Settings preference panel supports Undo (and Redo), so you can try out a change (or several changes) and revert changes you don't like.

A: Terminal.app has these colors hard-coded into it. Internal methods like +[NSColor(Terminal) vtRedColor] use hard-coded floating-point constants to set the colors.
As you noted, there are SIMBL plugins that can patch this but you've already noted their current limitations. SIMBL has been updated to support 64-bit applications, so you should contact the authors of the plugins to request that they rebuild them to support 64-bit. There's also another SIMBL plugin to consider.
The only other option for Terminal.app is to write a feature request at http://bugreport.apple.com and hope that somebody at Apple is enticed to add color customization to Terminal.app for Lion.

A: ANSI escape codes might do what you want. They're not as popular now as they were when everyone worked at a terminal over a modem, but they're still work in Terminal and iTerm and such ilk. I wouldn't be surprised to find that Terminal is using them behind the scenes to control its colors.
You might want to look at IBM's Prompt magic page. ANSI codes should allow you to customize the colors if you start with the Basic terminal profile.

Although I personally have no problems with it, I was wondering if iOS 4.2 offers any noticeable performance improvement. Does iOS 4.2 improve performance on the iPhone 3G?

A: From the iLounge article

Thus far iOS 4.2 appears to perform as
  well as iOS 4.1 did under similar
  conditions."|"Performance even on older
  devices such as the iPhone 3G is the

A: It actually seems faster than 4.1 to me on my 3G.

A: My iPhone 3G has become slower in some occasions with iOS 4.2 especially when pasting an address from Mail to Maps.

A: I have an iPhone 3G that I use for testing. 4.2.1 seems insanely slow on it, but maybe that's just because I've gotten so used to the speed of the 3GS and iPhone 4 over the past two years and forget what the ""normal"" speed of a 3G should feel like.

A: IOS4.2.1 is better than 4.1 for sure!!! I did not use yet the 3gs nor the iphone4, and got through every iOS ""upgrade"" available starting 3.1.3 , 4.0 , 4.0.1, 4.1 and probably yhe last one for the 3G 4.2.1 ! almost as fast as the 3.1.3 ,and with all the advantages of the 4.x ( folders, ibooks, faster maps, faster jawa, geo-tagging new caracters for notes, easier copy paste ((i think...)), etc. deffinatley a good option to upgrade! you will not be sorry!!!

A: My wife's 3GS which has 3.1.3 runs much faster than my 3GS with 4.3.5(BL1). However I cannot backup her unit in newly purchased MacBook Pro with Lion, but I can backup mine. I see it as Apple's way to force us to upgrade to their latest iOS even if that means to sacrifice performance.

EDIT: In addition to the Info.plist solution posted below, you also need the line
url_remoting_fn = load_url_in_new_buffer
in your .conkerorrc, if you want to open URLs in an existing window.

A: Select Conkerer as your default through Safari's preferences.
Update per the comment: From their website: ""Unfortunately, at this time, there doesn't seem to be a way on OSX to configure conkeror as your default browser. "" I just happened to stumble across that. I had never heard of"|"Conkerer until now.

A: Sure it's possible to set Conkeror as the default web browser; it just needs a properly structured Info.plist file.
I created one here: http://www.markdouma.com/developer/ConkerorInfoPlist.zip
Just download that, unzip it, and replace the following Info.plist file with the one included in the download:
/Applications/conkeror.mozdev.org/conkeror/Contents/Info.plist
Note: after completing this, make sure you touch the application bundle, which will force Launch Services to re-examine and re-register the app and its newly found capability for the http:// and https:// URL types. In other words, the following should be sufficient:
touch /Applications/conkeror.mozdev.org/conkeror.app
Then deselect and re-select the app icon in the Finder.
Launch Safari, and choose Conkeror from the popup menu:

A: springify, it's not possible to set conkeror as the default browser on OS X.

A: Have you checked out Default App? It's a preference pane you can install to set any app as a default for a number of different tasks. 
It's running on my Macbook running 10.6, and let's me choose any app I want for browsers; I don't have Conkerer but I can only assume it'd work for that too. Worth a download anyway.
Hope this helps.

A: So under the hood, Workgroup Manager creates a plist located at...
~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.internet.plist
Which contains this information...

733||"Q: New powercord for MacBook I am considering going on eBay to try and buy a new powercord for my MacBook. I know that phones often advise that you only use the official charger, so I was wondering if the same warning applied for laptops and if so, I serious I should take the warning.

A: Apple owns a patent on the magsafe connector and hasn't licensed anyone else to make one, I'd be very wary of buying a third party one if you find one at all.
However, best I can tell a magsafe charger"|"from any macbook seems to work with any other one, but if you get one with less wattage than your original it will charge slower.

A: I'm not sure about Laptop cables, but I've bought at least 3 camera battery chargers over the years from eBay, each one fused in a puff of smoke when plugged in, tripping my mains fuses.
I bought my 2nd MacBook cable direct from Apple. Expensive, but the peace of mind was worth it!
Incidentally, the 'Apple 60W MagSafe Power Adapter' works fine with my old 13"" Black MacBook '4,1'.

A: Any mag-safe charger from Apple should be fine with a standard MacBook. If you have a MacBook Pro, you'll want the higher-rated charger (85W I think). I doubt there are 'legal' 3rd party ones out there, and to be honest even if I found one I'd avoid it and just stick with official Apple spares.

A: Actually you should be careful when using a charger that doesn't come with your laptop. Apple's official word on the matter is:

Make sure the proper wattage adapter for your portable computer is used.
  Select the appropriate power adapter for your Apple portable computer. You can use a higher wattage power adapter, but you cannot use one with less wattage without potential operating issues. (here + discussion here). 

In the good old days (Powerbooks) we used to get all sorts of odd logic board hassles when using the wrong charger. These days it does mean a slower charging time but it can also mean the (very) rare logic board damage or hardware funkiness."|"is a type of power cord for charging a laptop computer, specifically the Apple MacBook. It is named for the distinctive circular connector on the end of the cord, which is designed to fit into a special socket on the laptop. These chargers are often sold separately from the laptop, and can be purchased from various retailers, including online auction sites like eBay.
As for the second part of your question, I don't have any specific advice about buying a third-party charger, but I can provide some general information. It is generally not recommended to buy products from unofficial or unlicensed sources, as they may not be of the same quality or safety standards as official products. Additionally, buying from unofficial sources may put you at risk of fraud or scams.
If you are still considering buying a third-party charger, I would recommend doing some research to ensure that the product you are buying is of high quality and meets all safety standards. You should also make sure that the seller is reputable and trustworthy. Finally, be sure to read any warranty or return policies carefully before making a purchase."|0.35878220200538635|0.12446351931330472
734||"Q: Is there a limit on the number of Macs that can use a single 2TB Time Capsule? I am looking at buying a few of the 2TB Time Capsules for our office, where we have about 20 unibody MacBook Pros with 128GB SSDs.
Is there a limit on the number of Macs that a single 2TB Time Capsule can provide Time Machine backup targets to? Does anyone have advice or experience regarding using a Time Capsule as a target for multiple machines?

A: According to this post on Apple's product page for the Time Capsule, up to 100 machines can use a single Time Capsule. The source of the ""100"" is not accredited, so it may not be accurate.

A: I would take care with having several Time Capsules as you will then have several Wireless networks and you need to work out how they interconnect.
It might be better to get some NAS and run Time Machine on that e.g. Netgear or even a Mac and run OS X server on that.

A: There shouldn’t be any technical limit other than hard drive space. Each backup gets stored in different directories inside the volume. However,"|"I’m sure you’d start running out of space fast if you have more than two-three machines that actively create/edit data. 

A: I use a LaCie d2 Quadra Hard Disk with TimeMachine and have so far backed up 6 different machines with it and recovered 2 times. I don't know if there is an upper limit.

A: This is a very workable solution. There is no built in limit and you can look over the system logs to see if any machines take too long to back up due to slowness and lighten the load on any one Time Capsule as needed.
For some people it's ideal, very maintainable, and drop dead simple to plan and support.
You can use BackupLoupe to look into the individual backups to see what files are changing and estimate how fast each Mac is filling up the space on the backup drives. You could use one Mac connected to the Ethernet port to scan the files without any WiFi delays and once scanned, you have the information on that Mac to examine ""offline"". You can mount the volumes and scan them as needed to update them as time passes - maybe once a month to check on things.
Do run a comparison on how much it would cost to buy a Mac mini server and use it to back up everything in one spot instead of several Time Capsules. You could then save money on the networking with Extremes and Expresses and have better expansion options. I would guess this is more cost-effective and easier/more powerful if you are buying three Time Capsules and might even be better even if you only are buying two Time Capsules.
Setting aside the cost of the initial hardware, a back of the napkin comparison might look like this assuming you need the TC for WiFi networking as well as backup functionality:


*

*Three Time Capsules


*

*Easier to set up initially (if you guess well or over-buy storage you may never need to maintain which Mac backs up where minimizing maintenance)

*Takes more time to plan and track which Mac backs up where 

*Harder to predict when space
will run out 

*Add space in increment of new Time Capsules (pricier storage)

*Takes more time to track / reconfigure clients when adding more space (especially if you intend to move the previous backup to the new TC and don't want to cut that user off from their backup history)

*TC backups are harder to backup, archive, or move around (if you even need this)


*One Mac mini + Airport Extreme + optional AirPort Express to extend the network


*

*Harder to set up initially (maybe one day's reading, learning, and doing)

*No hassle or time to shuffle or track which Mac backs up where

*Easier to predict when space will run out

*Can add more space by adding more drives (less pricey storage)

*No need to reconfigure clients as more space is added

*Very easy backup of the server and backup data (if you even need this)



You can minimize the work on maintaining a fleet of Time Capsules by periodically backing up each Mac to a connected HD and then deleting the backup for that Mac and starting Time Machine fresh. Rolling those with 1/4 of the Macs every three months will spread the work and let each Mac generally have a year of history before it gets erased and starts anew."|it’s best to have one Time Capsule per location since each Time Capsule can have multiple networks and you’ll need to configure them to communicate with each other.|0.380001962184906|0.04926108374384236

Is it true? If yes, is there anything I can do to ""clean up"" the salt in my iPhone?

A: I think your friend is confusing sea shanties with reality.  What old mariners call ""salt air"" is really just the smell of decaying seaweed and dead fish.
Salt, being a solid crystal, can't evaporate, so if there's any ""salt in the air"" it would be in the form of salt rocks flying around.  I imagine that's probably a lot"|"less likely than ""sand in the air"", since there's typically not a lot of unsequestered salt at the beach.  Also, I put salt crystals in glass all the time (e.g., measuring cups), and have yet to see the salt scratch the glass at all, so I think the chances of this hypothetical ""salt in the air"" causing damage to an iPhone are practically nonexistent.
I would worry more about a seagull pooping on it.

A: Well, you iPhone is pretty well sealed.  Unless you dropped the thing in the sand or ocean, you can probably just clean the outside with some safe cleaning product. (i.e. all purpose pledge, works for electronics, just spray onto rag first, then wipe phone).

A: While its true that cars and many other metal objects will rust faster near the ocean, the salt is hardly relevant for your iPhone unless you plan on leaving it exposed on the beach for a few months straight.
The oils/sweat from your hands and the general movements in and out of your bag/pocket/etc will clean up the minute amount of residual salt that might be on it (:
On top of that, I'm pretty sure its well sealed enough that, unless you actually had water spray directly on it or dropped it in the ocean, the insides will be fine and salt free.
Finally, the metal on the outside is stainless steel, which is very resistant to rust...
In short, ""she'll be right mate"".
(The first gen iPhones did have speaker/mic holes in the case that were perfectly sized to trap sand in the holes and you'd lose volume/clarity, but that's about the only real beach worry I can think of, and not an issue from the 3G onwards with their finer mesh on the speaker/mic).

So, what are the specific restrictions placed on downgrading? Can we just get our devices into DFU mode and apply whatever version we want? I don't want to end up buying a lot of devices if we only need one each.
We don't need any phone-only hardware such as the microphone or sending SMSs, so that's not a factor.
Cheers!

A: (I'm not certain of this answer -- it's a somewhat educated hunch, based on using iPods for 10 years and Apple products for 25, and looking at wikipedia.  If anyone knows from actual experience, use that answer instead.)
In general, I would guess that you can downgrade an iPod to the version of the OS that it was released with, but not earlier.  So, for example, an iPod Touch 2g could probably be downgraded to iPhone OS 2.1, but not 1.1 (which wouldn't really matter since there was no App Store in 1.x!).  Each iPod Touch gen-N ships with the N.1 release of iOS, about a month after the corresponding iPhone ships with the N.0 release.
An iPod Touch 2g should run all versions of iOS for the iPod Touch that have an App Store, though it doesn't support all the features of iOS 4.  The hardware differences between iPod models might be a bigger issue for testing, e.g., older iPods don't have a built-in microphone."|"Q: What are the specific restrictions on downgrading an iPod Touch to previous iOS versions?

A: From the DropDMG manual:

Sparse
  bundle disk images appear as a single
  file but are actually stored as a
  folder with many files inside. This
  makes it more efficient to back them
  up using Time Machine or other backup
  utilities, as only the changed parts
  need to be copied. Additionally,
  sparse bundle disk images work well
  with"|"the Compact Image… command.
  Compatible with Mac OS X 10.5 and
  later.
Sparse
  disk images are stored as a single
  file. This can make backups
  inefficient for large disk images,
  because the entire file must be copied
  each time. The Compact Image… command
  generally does not reclaim as much
  disk space as with sparse bundle disk
  images. Compatible with Mac OS X 10.3
  and later.


A: Sparse bundle disk image is an optimized form of the sparse disk image. It optimizes intentionally to reduce network load upon backup of changes to the filesystem at the expense of time and space. Specifically it uses a hashing function to store bits of data across a large directory structure which allows changes to be isolated in smaller band files. When copying the disk image elsewhere, rsync like tools will only need to copy the bands that change which makes incremental copies or backups far faster than moving the entire sparse image.
Local storage of the bundle img is less efficient in terms of space used, CPU time needed to process IO to the disk image is increased and when files are deleted, the reclamation of space is delayed and not as complete when compared to a sparse disk image. 
Unless you are backing up the bands incrementally online (as Time Machine does to Time Capsule) it's usually better to go with the sparse disk image over a sparse bundle. Some software will look inside a sparse image and only copy the changed blocks, but the bundle allows simpler tools to be more efficient moving changes around."|"### META DATA: {'language': 'en', 'url': 'https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5751', 'timestamp': '2023-03-29', 'source': 'stackexchange', 'question_score': '51'}

A: Something that may be of interest is Chrome does support 3 finger swipe down, but it's semi-hidden; and not what you're looking for. But it's way cool. The way to access it is by simply typing about:flags into your address bar. You'll see the option at the top. It's called:
Tab Overview:
Swipe down with three fingers on your trackpad to see an overview of all your tabs. Click on a thumbnail to select it. Works great in fullscreen mode.
So this suggests that they will not be doing what you would like them to do. It would obviously conflict with Tab Overview. So you should look into an app like JiTouch if you want to get more customized gesture support. It will do what you're looking for.
My guess is that Google's next step will be to map fullscreen to 3 finger swipe up; especially given the emphasis Lion will be putting on fullscreen mode apps.

I'm currently running with RunKeeper (to track my speed) and also wearing an chestband+wristwatch (to track my heart rate). It would be nice to get rid of the wristwatch, if there's some app (and chestband receiver hardware?) to combine the data.
I've seen some apps that only do heart rate monitoring, but I don't want to switch between 2 apps while running.

A: There is Digifit which is software that works with any ANT+ enabled devices by brand names such as Adidas, Garmin, StarTrac and Timex.

A: Runtastic has a solution for heart-rate sensor bands communicating with the Runtastic apps (which are similar to RunKeeper) via a sensor key which is attached to the iPhone: http://runtastic.com/en/sensors
The dongle is as expensive as for the Digifit, but the app is a lot more affordable.

A: Wahoo Fitness
You might like to check out Wahoo"|"Fitness - it's also an Ant+ dongle like Digifit, but unlike Digifit it works with a whole different ecosystem of apps (not just the default Digifit one) - defintely the widest range of all the apps you've listed here, and including Runkeeper as well so you don't need to change which running app you use.


Good luck, and happy running. 

A: My friend, there is no need stop using Runkeeper!
Runkeeper is fully compatible with great chest heart rate monitor - Beets BLU HRM! 
I use it with Runkeeper every day and I'm really satisfied.
There are also detailed setup insructions for Runkeeper on their  website: http://beetsblu.com/apps/app-store/runkeeper/

I'm very pleased with the entire solution.
And they have a Polar Heart Rate accessory now that will also monitored your heart beat.

P.S. I do not have a Nike+ Shoes... I use Asics, and I just put the sensor above my foot, works great!



A: I use Cyclemeter and Digifit at the same time Cyclemeter gives me updates thru my ear piece and I have Digifit running Visual

A: Polar app for iPhone keeps tabs on your heart:

Polar USA, longtime experts in fit tech, recently introduced a free iPhone training app that works with the company’s $80 Polar H7 Heart Rate Sensor. This product focuses more on gathering workout info, including where you went (if you run or jog), and how long you worked out. 

This was copied and pasted from
http://www.pcworld.com/article/2024238/bluetooth-powers-gizmos-for-health-wristwatches-and-more.html

A: I use the iSmoothRun app on my iPhone 4S with a Wahoo BlueHR HRM. This is an excellent combo because:


*

*iSmoothRun is independent. It can export your data to many different sites including Nike+ and Runkeeper (and dropbox!)

*iSmoothRun has very customizable exercise and voice feedback settings

*iSmoothRun listens to its users' feedback and fixes issues quickly

*The HRM is Bluetooth so it does not require a dongle (less bulk!)


A: I have been using the new Polar Bluetooth heart rate monitor with my iPhone 5 and Runkeeper and it works fine.
You can see three graphs on your webpage for free: pace, altitude and heart rate. I posted at Nike support and the answer is that they are thinking about it.

A: This is an interesting example of how the software got ahead of the hardware on iOS where the initial year or two of sensors were proprietary and locked to one vendor.
Today, you have several options for sensors that use Bluetooth 4.0 LE and can send heart rate signals to just about any app you choose.
I would look for a monitor that isn't tied to one app:


*

*Wahoo Blue HRM - chest mounted with elastic straps

*Mio Alpha - wrist watch (fairly large one at that)

*Mio Link - wrist band that just collects rate data and is much smaller than the Alpha.

A: Apple says:

Cleaning iPhone
Clean iPhone immediately if it comes in contact with any contaminants that may cause stains, such as ink, dyes, makeup, dirt, food, oils,"|"or lotions. To clean iPhone, disconnect all cables and turn off iPhone (press and hold the On/Off Sleep/Wake button, then slide the onscreen slider). Then use a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth. Avoid getting moisture in openings. Don’t use window cleaners, household cleaners, compressed air, aerosol sprays, solvents, alcohol, ammonia, or abrasives to clean iPhone. The front and back covers of iPhone 4 are made of glass and have an oleophobic coating. To clean these surfaces, simply wipe with a soft, lint-free cloth. The ability of this coating to repel oil will diminish over time with normal usage, and rubbing the screen with an abrasive material will further diminish its effect and may scratch the glass.

Or in other words: remember that little piece of cloth that came with your iPhone? That's all you should need.

A: I often slide the phone across my sweater (chest or sleeves) - anything that's soft, reasonably dry and clean, and won't scratch the glass will do.

Somehow, only the default Google calendar with my name is shown in the Calendar app. What should I do to make ALL my Google calendars appear and sync with my iPhone? Thanks!

A: There is an easy but non-obvious way to do this.
Assuming you've got Google sync set up, and you can see your one Google Calendar on your phone already, go to https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect (it needs the www; it doesn't have to be on your iPhone). You'll see a list of devices you're syncing. Select your iPhone.
On the next screen, you can choose which of your Google Calendars you want to sync with your iPhone. Check the box next to the desired calendars, then hit Done or Save or whatever it says at the bottom. 
Open iCal on your iPhone, and give it a while to sync, and you now should see all of your selected Google Calendars on your iPhone.
For some reason, you can't change the colors of the calendars on the iPhone, so I change the colors in Google Calendar to match what the iPhone picks. 
There used to be a limit of 5 Google Calendars that you could sync to the phone, but they recently raised the limit to 25.
These same"|"instructions apply to the iPad and iPod touch. I've got this set up on all my devices, and it works like a charm.
This is documented by Google here: http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206

A: I believe you can only do one Google calendar per account to the iPhone.  You can sync multiple Google accounts.
Here are some instructions, but I was unable to get it to work:
http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206
It would be a nice feature to have.

A: You'll need to create a different account on the iPhone for each calendar, but they can all point to your one Google account...


*

*You probably already know which calendar is the ""main"" one, as that's the one that the iPhone reads when you add the Google account.  You may have to delete that one from the phone (not from Google, of course) for now because sometimes the phone will complain that ""you already have an account for this set up.""

*For each non-main calendar, go to the calendar details on the Google Calendar web site and look for the ""ICAL"" icon under the ""Calendar Address"" section.

*Add the account on your phone, then edit the details for that account and enter the address from #2 above as the URL for the calendar.  (Under Advanced Settings)

*Rename the account on the phone accordingly so you know which calendar it is.

*Repeat for each non-main calendar.

*Finally, add the account as normal for the main calendar.


It's a bit of a hack, and I really wish there was better native support for multiple calendars in all kinds of applications/devices that interface with Google Calendar.  But, for now, this has been working really well for me.  It's just a pain to set it up in the first place.

A: I found this buried in Google's CalDAV info after following a rabbit trail.  No need to use Google Sync or create multiple accounts on the iPhone!
Syncing Multiple Calendars
By default only your primary calendar will be synced to your device. You can sync additional calendars by visiting the following page from any web browser:
https://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect
(Google Apps users can go to https://www.google.com/calendar/hosted/your_domain/iphoneselect, replacing 'your_domain' with your actual domain name.)
Select the calendars you'd like to sync, and click Save. The selected calendars will display on your device at the time of the next sync.

A: I was able to get multiple google calendars to show on the iPhone 4.  I added the first calendar under settings using ""Other Account"" CalDAV and plugging in my google account details.
When I tried to add another account in the same manner the iphone blocked it.
I then logged into my google account, accessed Calendar Settings for the secondary calendar and found the private URL for ICAL.  I copied this URL and then used skype to text message it to my iphone.  Once the URL popped up on iphone I clicked it.  The phone asked me if I wanted to subscribe to the calendar and I clicked yes.
Boom!  Two google calendars on my iphone.  One caveat.  The secondary calendar cannot be edited from my iphone.  But this is no problem for me and I am happy.

A: After syncing you may come across calendars not displaying (for whatever reason), despite them showing up on your calendar list in your calendar app.  To remedy this, open Settings.app -> Mail, Contacts, & Calendars -> [your account].

Sadly, that didn't enable mcrypt for me last night, although I was pretty pleased that I got 5.3.3 running. :)
The problem is that I have woken up this morning to find that my php version is back down to 5.3.1 which can only mean that OS X has reverted to my original Apache and PHP.
How to I tell OS X to use the software I installed via MacPorts?
(And then I will as a new question of how to enable mcrypt)

A: It's not so much your version of Apache/PHP have been reverted -"|"it's just the wrong version is loaded.
If you have Mac OS X's Web Sharing enabled it will auto enable the version of Apache and PHP Apple provides using the LaunchDaemon org.apache.httpd.plist in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons (this will override MacPorts version). You'll want to disable this by either turning off Web Sharing in the Sharing Preference Pane or by running sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist.
When you installed Apache for MacPorts it installed a LaunchDaemon into /Library/LaunchDaemons which if enabled will start up the MacPorts version of Apache automatically. To enable it run sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.apache2.plist and you're off to the races.
If you're running apachectl to restart - make sure you've selected the right version. You may need to alter your $PATH to have /opt/local/apache2/bim before /usr/sbin
As for what version of PHP is being used; on the command line this will depend on your $PATH while for Apache it's entirely in your configuration of where the libphp5 module is. (/etc/apache2/ for the built in version, /opt/local/apache2/conf for the version MacPorts installed)

A: Why does OS X need to know which Apache to use?  Just run the correct Apache yourself.  Open up Terminal, cd to the MacPorts directory containing the correct Apache (probably /opt/something/something/something/Apache2/bin or something like that), and run it (probably something like ./httpd).

A: You have two solutions : 


*

*You have to edit the global PATH variable to add MacPort folders at the beginning. It contains the order of folders the system uses to find binaries.

*Backup original binaries (in /usr/bin, /bin, …), then add symlinks to MacPorts binaries.


Normally, do not use option 2 until you really know what you're doing. I just mentioned it because it's technically possible.
To edit the global PATH variable, edit the file /etc/paths, add /opt/local/bin at the beginning and finally reboot to apply changes.
You can control, after the reboot, that changes have been made by do the following command : 

echo $PATH

I've found that this doesn't really affect the main history, but it does affect the ""Other"" history, which is a list of recently visited URLs that only I can see.
So, I've found that I can remove the URL from the ""Other"" history by doing the following:
1. Open the ""Other"" history.
2. Find the URL in the list.
3. Press the Delete key.
4. Wait a few seconds.
5. Refresh the main history.
6. Voila! The URL has been removed from the main history.

Does this sound like a good approach to you? Or am I doing something dumb here?"|0.31750649213790894|0.18487394957983194

A: You can use KeyRemap4MacBook with the PCKeyBoardHack. It also allows you to use Emacs keys in any Mac app, including the ones not using Cocoa such as MS apps.  

A: From ""Updating modifier key mappings through defaults command tool"":
defaults -currentHost write -g com.apple.keyboard.modifiermapping.1133-50475-0 -array '<dict><key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc</key><integer>0</integer><key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst</key><integer>2</integer></dict>
Change 1133 and 50475 to the vendor and product IDs shown by ioreg -n IOHIDKeyboard -r. src 0 and dst -1 would disable caps lock.
defaults -currentHost write -g modifies:
~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences.*.plist
You have to log out and back in to apply changes. If the values are strings (like in the answer by @pithyless), the changes are shown in System Preferences but they don't have any effect.
Values of keys:
-1 none
0 caps lock
1 left shift
2 left control
3 left option
4 left command
5 keypad 0
6 help
9 right shift
10 right control
11 right option
12 right command


A: I wanted to swap Right Command with Right Option keys only.
When I setup global Command and Option swap in System Preferences... > Keyboard > Modifier Keys..., there is following config in the system (which works as expected):
$ defaults -currentHost read -g com.apple.keyboard.modifiermapping.1452-591-0
(
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771299;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 30064771298;
    },
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771303;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 30064771302;
    },
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771298;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 30064771299;
    },
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771302;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 30064771303;
    }
)

But when I modify it, to swap only Right side as below - it doesn't work:
$ defaults -currentHost write -g com.apple.keyboard.modifiermapping.1452-591-0 '(
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771303;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 30064771302;
    },
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771302;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 30064771303;
    }
)'

It's because values are written as strings not integers. You can see that using:
$ plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/.GlobalPreferences.*.plist

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC ""-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"" ""http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"">
<plist version=""1.0"">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.keyboard.modifiermapping.1452-591-0</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst</key>
            <string>30064771303</string>
            <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc</key>
            <string>30064771302</string>
        </dict>
        <dict>
            <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst</key>
            <string>30064771302</string>
            <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc</key>
            <string>30064771303</string>
        </dict>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>

So the right way to update the setting is using XML format:
$ defaults -currentHost write -g com.apple.keyboard.modifiermapping.1452-591-0 -array \
'<dict>
    <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst</key>
    <integer>30064771303</integer>
    <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc</key>
    <integer>30064771302</integer>
</dict>' \
'<dict>
    <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst</key>
    <integer>30064771302</integer>
    <key>HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc</key>
    <integer>30064771303</integer>
</dict>'

At the end, you have to log off and log in again.

A: Combining a few answers together I came up with this script that seems to work (mapping Caps-lock to Control).
$ keyboard_id = ""$(ioreg -n IOHIDKeyboard -r | grep -e VendorID\"" -e ProductID | tr -d \""\|[:blank:] | cut -d\= -f2 | tr '\n' -)""
$ defaults -currentHost write -g ""com.apple.keyboard.modifiermapping.${keyboard_id}0"" '(
{
  HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 2;
  HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 0;
})'

Only problem that it doesn't seem to take any effect... :(
I'll update if it I get it to work."|"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 1; 
 }
 )'
else
 echo ""Switching to default modifiers""
 defaults -currentHost write -g $mappingplist '( 
 { 
 HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 4; 
 HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 2; }, 
 { 
 HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 12; 
 HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 10; 
 }, 
 { 
 HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 2;

defaults -currentHost read -g $mappingplist

I also run Windows 7 on Boot Camp partition and I normally use Parallels 6 to run it, but I noticed that Time Machine does not backup Boot Camp partition.

What is your Boot Camp Windows 7 on-site backup strategy? I'd like to avoid buying another external HDD for Windows...

A: Using Snow Leopard Disk Utility, I made three partitions on an external hard drive:


*

*HFS+  for Time Machine

*MSDOS, subsequently converted to NTFS, for Windows 7 backup

*EXFAT for shared media e.g. iTunes Library


I have not yet made a final decision about what backup package to use for Windows 7.  At the moment, I'm using Microsoft's Windows 7 backup solution, with manual image files, and trying to keep any data files in the Cloud.
I do not yet have even 10 days experience with this setup.

A: I keep my documents on the Mac side as I'm pretty much only using Parallels to run my BootCamp install, so that way they're backed up. I don't really mind doing a fresh reinstall of windows if something goes wrong.

A: WinClone
Saves your whole Windows installation as an image that you can restore later. Excellent for backing up and restoring Windows bootcamp installations, but the developer is gone, but the software may still work though. 
Some people say it works on Snow Leopard, while it doesn't. I'm planning on using it in a hard drive upgrading, but that's just me. Should work fine though.

A: I'm using iPartition and Disk Utility for this. Makes sparse images (i.e. doesn't copy empty space from Windows side). Could be more automated, but I'm pleased.

 ### CONTINUATION: cannot answer that part of the question. As far as I can see, the original question only mentions contacts. For contacts, the original question says that the data should be transferred to the iPhone, but does not specify how. I can suggest two possible methods:

1. Move the data from the Samsung phone to the iPhone using a cable. You will need to connect the iPhone and the Samsung phone to the same computer to do this.
2. Move the data from the Samsung phone to the iPhone using an app on the iPhone. You will need to download an app from the App Store that can transfer data from a Samsung phone to an iPhone.

A: Today, I'd go with either a 15"" or 17"" MacBook Pro. They would allow you to work with the iPad simulator at its native resolution. It's a bit too big to run full-size on the 13"" models, so I always end up"|"running it at half size, which is less than ideal. Even if you're not planning to develop for the iPad right now, I'd still plan the hardware purchase around that possibility. The likelihood that you'll do iOS development and never build for the iPad is pretty low.
Beyond the simulator issues, I like to have the largest screen possible when I'm programming. I have a 13"" MacBook Pro, but I connect it to a 24"" monitor when I'm at my desk. If you're like me, the 17"" would be ideal, if you don't want to have a second screen.
However, Apple is holding a Mac-focused special event tomorrow, and it's never a good idea to buy a Mac this close to one of those events. The entire laptop line is due for updates, and there has been (unconfirmed) speculation that any new models may run at higher screen resolutions, especially on the smaller end of the range.

Categorizing the pdf assets from within iPad or iPod is possible now. But I think it is more elegant if I can make the categorization from within iTunes in advance.
Is it possible to arrange or categorize the imported pdf assets from within  iTunes first and then sync the devices (iPod,iPad) with iTunes?

A: You might want to look at Calibre. Famously one of the ugliest Mac apps ever created (although it's much nicer"|"looking now), Calibre is an e-book manager. You can use it to process your books, categorize them, tidy up the metadata etc. and then hit ""send to device"" to copy the books into iTunes.
I originally used it because my ePub collection for my Sony Reader was in it, and so it was the easiest way to get that to my iPad, but I've stuck with it because it has lots more features than iTunes.

A: Within iTunes-Books, you can view all the ePub books and PDFs you have available to sync to your iPhone or iPad. The PDFs will have a spiral bound edge and the ePubs have either a brown generic cover, the cover art included in the download or the cover art you added via ""Get Info""-""Artwork"". If you rename the PDF with a number (01-10...) before the title, it will automatically sort via name and put the 01s together Alphabetically and so on down the number line. This is not as nice as setting up a ""compilation"" like you can do with audio books or multi-CD albums but it should sort your PDFs for you.

A: I took a quick look in the iTunes Music Library.xml and couldn't find my books in there (music, movies, TV shows, podcasts and audiobooks are all in there - books and pdfs are missing). The Book category does not seem to affect the Album/Grouping/Genre metadata of the book (from iPhone to iTunes) and the Album/Grouping/Genre metadata does not seem to affect the Book category (from iTunes to iPhone).
If I remember correctly, the iBooks app asked me if I wanted my bookmarks and other data to be stored on my AppleID account and I confirmed. If the categories are stored along with the bookmarks in the cloud then you are in tough luck until Apple decides to add this functionality to iTunes."|"Q: Is it possible to arrange or categorize the imported pdf assets from within iTunes first and then sync the devices (iPod,iPad) with iTunes?

Am I missing something here - can I use iPhoneBrowser for this, or if not, is there another app that does what I"|"want?

A: My suggestion would be to get DataViz's Documents To Go. It provides the capability of editing Word documents on your iOS device and the 'premium' version interfaces with Dropbox (or similar services) to synchronize the changes to and from your PC. I haven't personally used their iOS version, but I did use their Palm version several years ago and it worked quite well.

Microsoft Word Editing
View, edit and create Microsoft Word documents on the go and experience the freedom of being able to review and update any of the Word documents you rely upon; anytime, anywhere. Advanced viewing and editing features include touch navigation, cut/copy/paste, bulleted and numbered lists, fonts, embedded pictures, tables, word count, password-protected files and the ability to edit in landscape view.
Online/Cloud Documents Support
('Documents To Go Premium' only)
  Download, view and edit your files from your Google Docs, Box.net, Dropbox, MobileMe iDisk or SugarSync account directly in Docs To Go. Any changes you make can be saved and synchronized back to the online account so that you'll always have the most up-to-date version. You can even create new files in Docs To Go and upload them immediately to your account.


A: The paid version of quick office (quick office connect mobile suite I think it's called) allows you to add various online storage services: google docs, dropbox, box.net and mobile me. You upload/sync your files on your computer to one of these services then add your account to quick office and you will be able to access and write to the files on the service you added. 
Quickoffice also has local storage where you can download files to from one of the services. This is useful if you know you'll want to access a big file when your not on wifi. You can download it while on wifi and then access it later offline. 
And vice versa you can create a document locally when and the upload it to a service later.  
Each iPhone app has it's own sandbox which it can modify and read. It can't see or modify any other apps sandbox. So iPhone browser will only see files you added using iPhone browser. iOS 4 now has a documents facilty where if an app can read a word document such as quickoffice it registers that it cam do that and if an app can list files such as the official dropbox app you can open a document in the dropbox app and it will show a Hutton which you can press to open the document in quick office. 
Quickoffice also has the ability to openema attachments. However I haven't used this so I don't know how it works."|"Q: Can I use iPhoneBrowser to upload a directory structure to Office Connect?

A: If you use Dropbox (and you should), I recommend GrabBox. When you take a regular screenshot (command-shift-3, command-shift-4, etc.) it automatically uploads it to your public folder, grabs the public URL, optionally shortens it, and copies it to the clipboard.

A: Two of the best apps for this are CloudApp and Skitch.
Cloud app has an option to automatically upload screenshots (image courtesy of Softpedia). It is very drag and drop friendly and pastes the URL to your clipboard for convenience.
Skitch is a little more heavy on the screen snapping controls. It's like grab on steroids. You can quickly hide private information, point out items, and edit the snap before uploading.
The free version of both are well worth it. Both have paid upgrades that are low cost, but you don't need to pay to use either. I have also heard really good things about Droplr so you might check it out as well.

Both CloudApp and Skitch are available on the App Store. The two are better together - skitch is better for grabbing a great screen shot, and droplr for upload and sharing it.

A: Dropshare is another paid option that has come along - in the vein of TinyGrab and LittleSnaper (which Realmac has replaced with Ember) mentioned already.
Both the OS X and iOS version can:


*

*Upload to S3, Rackspace or your own server (via SCP over SSH)

*Global hotkeys for uploading clipboard, screenshot/recording or note (MarkDown supported)

*Create optional, custom landing pages for your files

*Sync connections/preferences via Dropshare's own sync service

*Shorten URLs using services or custom shorteners

*Delete previously shared files directly via the app


Three-day trial of the OS X version's available at their site.

I've been pleased using it for the past few months.

A: I wrote a small python script to do that.
It will not just auto upload screenshots to imgur but also copy screenshot url to clipboard and open up browser with link instantly.
Check it out:
Video Demo:
Link

A: LittleSnapper is designed to work with FTP and copy the URL after upload. Upload is a separate step from snapping, so you will have to set a key command or automate that for the exact functionality you ask.
There is a free trial version from the RealMac website - so you can see if it's what you want before buying a license."|"#!/bin/sh

Is there a way to run abc.exe with 'abc.exe' not 'mono abc.exe'? I mean, when I run 'abc.exe', can I make 'mono abc.exe' called automatically?

A: See this link
Basically what you have to do is to use one of the Mono tools (mkbundle is a generic one while macpack is designed to work on Mac OS X) to link all your application executables, resources and dll in a"|"single executable file that can be later run as a single app.
From the macpack doc:
macpack is a tool that must be used to bundle Cocoa# applications into Double-Clickable, Finder friendly, bundles on Mac OS X. It bundles static libraries and resources, as well as generates a basic info.plist into the .app bundle.
For example the following commands are used to build the CurrencyConverter.exe into an application bundle:
$ mcs -g -debug+ CurrencyConverter.cs -out:CurrencyConverter.exe -pkg:cocoa-sharp
$ rm -rf CurrencyConverter.app
$ macpack -m:2 -o:.  -r:/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/    
  libCocoaSharpGlue.dylib -r:CurrencyConverter.nib -n:CurrencyConverter 
  -a:CurrencyConverter.exe

The resulting CurrencyConverter.app is just another Mac OS X application as far as the Finder is concerned, and can be opened from Finder, or launched from Terminal using the open -a CurrencyConverter command.

A: Improving Calavera’s answer to allow you to do it with a parameter, the script should look like:
#!/bin/bash
mono $1

That way you can do:
./abc.sh name_of_the_app.exe

I would have added this as a comment, but the format would have been lost

A: I don't have a lot of experience with mono but you'll probably have to create an executable shell script that does the mono call for you.  Something like:
$ vi abc.sh

What if you want to go to the menu at the top of the screen for an application you're using, but in the process briefly hover over another application?  That would become infuriating quickly.
In short, I don't think its doable for that and potentially other reasons.

A: Best little utility I stumbled upon is Zooom/2. Strange name, hence hard to find. You can choose delay (Rather cumbersome, OS X and global menu is not designed to allow that). I set it to focus window under cursor instantly when Option key is pressed. Great value, no dock or tray icons, it just works.

It would be nice if this second click wasn't needed, which leads me to my question:

I also have lots of one-off pictures that people send me that I want to keep.  Not sure they deserve their own event, though, as the Events page is becoming pretty large.
What is a reasonable way to manage these"|"pictures (and I hope that this questions meets the subjectivity benchmark)?  Make a ""Single Picture"" event?  Do pictures even have to be part of events, but if not, how do I find them again?

A: Photos need to be part of events; deleting a photo from an event deletes the photo from your Photo Library (unlike albums where deleting the photo just removes it from the album). If I was you I'd create a 'One-Off' or 'Photos I like' event. 
You could create a big event for everything you don't want to be in its own event folder. This should let the Events feature be used for what it's designed for - organising your photos by significant dates. If Events seems like too much hassle then you can just ignore them all together, make your own albums and organise them manually. 
Personally I just use events to find photos from 'the picnic' or 'that time we went to the airport', I don't bother organising or sorting my events. 

A: Personally, what I do, is make a folder called ""Random Pics"", and whenever I have single picture events, I just grab them in the Events view and drag them on top of the the ""Random Pics"" event and it adds the pics to that event and gets rid of the single photo event."|"single-picture events? A:I can see why you’re looking to clean up your iPhoto library, it can get pretty messy with all those events and photos. Here’s a way to organize them:

- Then, go to the “One-off” event and delete all the photos in it.
- Finally, delete the “One-off” event.

Page outs:  1.6 MB
Swap used:  8.1"|"MB
How can there be more swap used than the amount paged out?

A: My understanding is this:


*

*Program needs access to some data.  Attempts to do so, and fails, due to lack of RAM.

*OS takes control.  There is a page-out operation, where physical RAM is copied to swap.

*There is a page-in operation, where the required data is copied to RAM.

*OS gives control back to program.

*Program tries again, finds its data.


OS's are getting smart about how they choose what and when to to page in/out.  So the operation counts may not be the same, and the swap space may perhaps be in use without there being page outs.
Unless of course I'm backwards on what a page-in/page-out operation is.  In which case your question makes perfect sense."|A:I think this has to do with the way Activity Monitor is measuring “swap”. It’s probably using the virtual memory system, which is a kind of “demand paging” system. In demand paging, the operating system doesn’t allocate physical memory to a process until it needs it, so there’s no “swap” file associated with each process. Instead, the operating system uses the “swap” space on the system partition to handle pageouts. So when Activity Monitor shows “swap used” it’s probably just showing the total amount of swap space allocated to the system, which is not useful for understanding the relationship between pageouts and swap used for individual processes.|0.4279932975769043|0.15079365079365076

With regard to detailed bandwidth monitoring, the Airport Extreme supports SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) so if you want to put in a bit of effort, you could set up Cacti http://www.cacti.net/ and point that at the base station.

Update II
One solution seems to be to switch to 802.11n only 5 GHz (2.4 GHz does not help). The downside: iPhone and many older notebooks don't support it...

A: Something to try is to turn off IPv6 support in your networking preference control panel for wireless, and even for ethernet if you are hardwired.
Mine would drop connections randomly and I'd have to mess around and eventually would pull its power and let it restart to restore sanity. Then, I read somewhere it was a problem with IPv6 support, and turn it off on our Macs. Now it's very stable. 
I stopped using it for my wireless router, and now use it for AirTunes. Very seldom will it lag, and when it does it'll sync up again by itself. I really can't remember the last time it ""weirded out"" on me, even though some days I'll be playing music through it for most of the day.

A: Just in case you're still experiencing the issue. I've been having that happen with my early 2008 MBP for two years now. I seem to have found two half-solutions, see below. Please see if they work for you.
To recap:


*

*Rate is usually good (54)

*drops after minutes, sometimes hours

*rate is good in most all other networks I happen to be in


So, the first thing I noticed is that when I alt-click the airport icon the rate rises from 1 to a rate somewhat higher, maybe 2 or 4 or 8. It then usually drops again. When I alt-click several times in quick succession, I can get the rate to rise up to 48. But again, only to see it drop again.
My first half-solution is this: I found out that whenever I experience the rate dropping I can change the channel in my router from, say 1 to 6 or 11, which will usually resolve the issue. After I reconnect to the network things will be fine for a while (minutes, hours, sometimes a day or two).
My second half-solution is turning off all other wireless clients in the network. Whenever I'm alone at home and my laptop is the only computer running, everything's fine. I seem to be having the dropping-rate-problem only when other clients are in the same network, especially when one of them is using the network intensely. I'm almost certain about that now. Please try and see if removing all other clients ""solves"" your issue.
Whenever it is not avoidable to have other clients in the network, I try the first half-solution (sometimes 2 or 3 times) and it usually does the trick.
Incredibly annoying though!

A: Your wireless card in the computer need replacing. I have 2 Mac Books. an old 2008 Core Duo that does exactly what you describe. And a new Mac Air.

*Active: Active memory that contains information that is actively being used.

*Inactive: Inactive memory contains information that is not actively being used. Leaving this information in RAM is to your advantage if you (or a client of your computer) come back to it later.

*Used: Used memory is being used by a process or by the system.

*Free: Free memory is not being used and is immediately available.

*VM size: Virtual memory, or VM, is hard disk space that can be used as memory. VM size is the amount of disk space being used as memory. Mac OS X can use more memory than the amount of physical RAM you have. A hard disk is much slower than RAM, so the virtual memory system automatically distributes information between disk space and RAM for efficient performance.
Page ins/outs: The number of gigabytes of information Mac OS X has moved between RAM and disk space


A: Apple updated the Activity Monitor in OSX 10.9 (Mavericks). They have a good article about what everything means here http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5890. In summary...



*

*Physical Memory: The amount of RAM installed.

*Memory Used: The amount of RAM being used and not immediately available for other apps.

*Virtual Memory: The amount of memory mapping that apps have asked for. This is not an actual consumption of RAM resources and it size is determined by the author of the app.

*Swap Used: The space on your drive being used to swap unused files to and from RAM. It is normal to see some activity and it is not a indication that you have depleted RAM resources. Seeing memory pressure in the Red state will indicate that RAM resources are depleted.

*App Memory: The amount of space being used by apps.

*Wired Memory: Memory that can’t be cached to disk, so it must stay in RAM. This memory can’t be borrowed by other apps.

*Compressed: The amount of memory in RAM that is compressed, making more RAM resources available for other apps.

*File Cache: The space in RAM marked as available for apps to use that contains recently used files.



Memory Pressure graph
The combination of Free, Wired, Active, Inactive & Used memory statistics in previous versions of Activity Monitor have been replaced in Mavericks with an easy to read ""Memory Pressure"" graph.
Memory pressure is indicated by color:


*

*Green – RAM memory resources are available.

*Amber – RAM memory resources are being tasked.

*Red – RAM memory resources are depleted and OS X is using the drive for memory.


A: Taken from my answer at Server Fault:
Mac OS X Memory Jargon:
Wired : This refers to kernel code and such. Memory that should not ever be moved out of the RAM. Also know as resident memory.
Shared : Memory that is shared between two or more processes. Both processes would show this amount of memory so it can be a bit misleading as to how much memory is actually in use.
Real : This is the ""real"" memory usage for an application as reported by task_info() - a rough count of the number of physical pages that the current process has. (RSIZE)
Private : This is memory that a process is using solely on its own that is used in Resident memory. (RPRVT)
Virtual : The total amount of address space in the process that's mapped to anything - whether that's an arbitrarily large space for variables or anything - it does not equate to actual VM use. (VSIZE)
Active : Memory currently labelled as active and is used RAM.
Inactive : ""Inactive memory is no longer being used and has been cached to disk. It will remain in RAM until another application needs the space. Leaving this information in RAM is to your advantage if you (or a client of your computer) come back to it later."" - Mac OS X Help
Free : The amount of RAM actually available without any data.

Despite the fact that"|"badges are turned off, my Facebook and Mint applications continue to show red numerical badges on their icons.
I'd like to turn these badges off. Why are they continuing to show?

A: The Notifications settings panel only controls what push notifications can do when the app is not running.  Background changing of the badge, essentially.  When you run the app, it is free to change its own badge and as far as I know there isn't a way to keep an app from doing that.

A: The application has to provide a way to turn off/on badges.  Some apps provide that through the notifications setting, some in their own app settings (under Settings), and some within the app itself and some not at all.  The Facebook app does not seem to abide by the Notifications settings, so that request would need to be made to them to update their app to allow us to turn off badges if we so choose."|"that I have Badges turned off for the Facebook and Mint applications on my iPhone 4 running 4.0.2 (Settings -> Notifications -> Facebook/Mint -> Badges: OFF ), I have Alerts and Sounds turned on.

I wonder if Apple's warranty is international, and/or what warranty coverage exists when I return to my country.
Where can I understand what Apple Warranty covers in the US when products leave the US?

A: I bought an ipad in January 2013 (10 mths ago) in the USA. It started giving problems a few weeks ago by restarting for itself every 2 mins. I took it at the apple dealer and repair center in South Africa where I currently stay, they tried fixing it but said that it needs to be replaced but they can't replace it since its under international warranty and they only deal with South African bought products. 
So I guess the warranty is not international

A: Apples warranties are international except for the iPhone where the warranty is only valid in the country the phones was bought in.

A: Apple Warranty is international and you can use your warranty on every country that apple has branch.
but other than"|"warranty you can buy AppleCare Protection.
Apple has “global repair coverage” If you carry your Apple computer or iPod when you travel and happen to need repair service, AppleCare Protection Plan offers global repair coverage.
but for this you need to purchase AppleCare Protection , and if you want go to other country to buy your product cheaper AppleCare Protection not a good Idea. 

A: Yes it's international.
My friend bought a MacBook in the US and had a warranty case in Switzerland. The warranty case got solved without any problems.

A: AppleCare warranty is international, sort of no questions asked (unless you take in a soaking iPod).
Apple's limited 1 year warranty is sort of international. As in, your local Apple Service Provider may provide you with warranty or may choose to be very strict on the wording and not cover anything they don’t have to cover to the letter of the law and agreement.

A: Yes, Apple's computer warranties are international. Worst case, you have to ship your product back to the purchasing country if Apple asks for that, but the wording and common practice is U.S. purchases generally get covered everywhere Apple has service globally.
See Apple's Warranty Page for more details. The warranty is established in the country of purchase and if warranty service is not available in the country where the device is when service is requested, you may be on the hook for import/export duties as well as paying for the shipping.
No, iPhone and some parts of AppleCare plus are not necessarily international.

Pay attention to parts like:

IMPORTANT RESTRICTION FOR iPHONE, iPAD AND APPLE TV SERVICE.
Apple may restrict warranty service for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV to the country where Apple or its Authorized Distributors originally sold the device.

That doesn’t mean you won’t get service, but you could be denied or could have to get the device back to the country of purchase on your dime to get service.
Also, no in terms of consumer law varying widely between Europe, Asia, US and other countries:

*

*How does Apple's two year warranty in Europe work?
To recap:

*

*Warranty is what Apple offers and you may have responsibilities or costs to get service

*Consumer law covers things outside the warranty, so you need to balance both when choosing where to buy

*Look for words like shall and may and must - these contracts are legal and  /or prescriptive so details and words matter. Read all the document, several times before spending money if you don’t know the return policy or have limited time to return goods after purchasing them.


A: Read my answer here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/13285/34885 in the comments (look for my name: madivad). I can vouch that:
iPhones warranties are NOT international.

*

*Some rogue apps that ran in the background were silently draining my battery even though they shouldn't


Possibility 1 is very remote. So I would like to investigate on possibility 2. How to know what causes the iphone battery to drain out even when it is not in use?
Edit: I switched 3G and WIFI off when I was sleeping.

A: There is a"|"general tips page on maintaining great battery life, as well as general terms about battery replacement.
Personally: This sounds like a bad battery. It sounds like it just plainly is not holding a charge after a certain discharge point. Remember that iOS multitasking is not true multitasking. Barring streaming audio (actually persistent audio in general), there is (almost) NOTHING that your phone can constantly do for more than 20 minutes at a time.
I've streamed audio for hours (hours being... maybe 5?) during the day at ~40% and it did get under 20% by the time I was done, this was both on an iPad, and roughly equivalent on an iPhone 4. Connected WiFi, 3G (on the iPhone) enabled but not being the active radio in use, of course.
I don't know that you're able to see what's draining the battery, Apple forbids ""task management apps"". A possible workaround to see if it is app involved or a bad battery, is to drain your phone to a similar level, open the fast app switcher bar (double tap the home button), tap-hold on any application in the task bar until they begin to ""jiggle"", then press the white minus inside the red circle on EVERYTHING. This will kill any and all tasks that aren't first-party. (For example, it will not stop the occasional housekeeping/tasks that Mail, Phone, Safari, or other built-in apps are allowed to do.)
Having said that, to properly test, ensure that mail's auto-fetch is off (or in push only mode at best), make sure that you have no tabs in Safari with ""live"" or automatically refreshing content. Safari IS ALLOWED TO BACKGROUND, and has always been able to, to the best of my knowledge. At least since iOS 2.something (where I started with an iPhone 3G).

A: A note to those who find this QA: a link here from Apple can be helpful.
This morning when my battery was draining out, I tried the above tips ( reproduced below), and it worked. 

If you have an Exchange email account
  you probably have some stale sync
  threads. Try this:
Go to Settings/Mail,contacts,calendar.
  Tap the name of the account. Turn off
  the 3 switches. Back out to the main
  settings page. Now launch mail, then
  contacts, then calendar to kill the

794||"Q: How can I set a default zoom level in Safari? I've got a Mac Mini that I'm using as a Home Theatre PC, and my only real complaint is that I can't set a default zoom level in Safari. It's hard to read all that tiny text from 7 feet away from my TV set, so I'm always zooming in.
So: is there some extension or hidden hack way to force Safari to zoom in automatically?

A: There is a wonderful safari extension, SafariMagnifier, which can set default zoom-in scale for every page. 
http://www.wannseii.com/safarimagnifier/

A: As Am1rr3zA mentioned, you can select a custom style sheet from the preferences:

I have added these rules to my safari.css file:
html {
    zoom: 125%;
}
img {
    zoom: 75%;
}
@media print {"|"html {
        zoom: 100%;
    }
}

It has a lot of annoying side-effects though. But ZoomBySite and AllPagesZoom have the same side-effects, and there is also a noticeable delay before AllPagesZoom changes the zoom level.

A: If you go to ""preferences"" in the Safari tab and then to ""advanced"" you can click the ""Never use font sizes smaller than"" button and then pick the font size you want.  Then you won't have to squint and get real close to the screen to read it anymore.

A: All Pages Zoom
...allows to ""easily set one zoom level for all websites and have it remembered."" I'm using it in Safari 5.1.7.
You can download it from Apple's extension gallery under productivity or directly from the developer.


A: After 6 years, we finally have this feature in native Safari 10, so no more CSS or extension required (I used to apply CSS, but it broke many sites as pointed out by @adib):

UPDATE: Thanks to @wisbucky, Safari 11.0 actually has a new design. It can now memorize the zoom level per site. Also, we can custom this by the menu item ""Safari"" --> ""Settings for This Website..."", and the exact option ""Page Zoom"" can be found there. More detailed information can be found here and here.

A: According to this post from Apple's Safari Support discussion forum:

1) Create a file named defaultzoom.css (or any name you like, just make sure it has a css extension.)
2) Copy and paste in the following:  
    body {  
      zoom: 130%;  
    }

change 130 to whatever number suits you. >100 means zoom in, <100 means zoom out. Don't forget the % percent sign!
3) In safari, go to Preferences > Advanced. Under style sheet, select Other... and point to the file you created.
4) You may need to restart safari for the change to take effect.


[In the above, both the emphasis and code formatting (for non-code-related text) were added to the original quote by Am1rr3zA].

A: In the latest version of Safari (11), go to:
Safari -> Preferences -> Websites -> Page Zoom
There you can set the default page zoom for all sites or a specific site. 
This seems to be a native feature of Safari now (the Page Zoom setting under the Advanced tab in preferences is gone.)"|"html {
 zoom: 125%;
 }
 img {
 zoom: 75%;
 }
}

This will apply the styles to all pages, but you can also apply them to specific pages by adding them to the <style> tag in the head of the page.

A: You can try to use the ""z"" key to zoom in. It should work like a hotkey.
If this doesn't work for you, you can try to install a Safari extension like ""SafariMagnifier"".
If neither of these solutions work for you, you can try to set the ""zoom"" property in the ""html"" tag of the page to the desired value. For example:

795||"Q: Is it possible to reduce the disk space required to install Mac OS X 10.6? I was hoping to install Mac OS X on a flash-based drive I have, but it's only 4GB. The installer tells me there's not enough free space, but it doesn't specify how much I need free.


*

*Does anyone know the exact minimum?

*Is it possible to create a custom install with only the bare basics and install within 4GB?


A: The minimum install that comes off the DVD is ~6 gigabytes. If you want to make a smaller install, the easiest thing to do is install it on another partition, trim down the installation, then copy it over to the target drive using ditto or Carbon Copy Cloner.
Though I do not recommend doing any of these, there are a couple of thing installed in the default system that can be trimmed out to save space:


*

*All app binaries are installed 2 way fat (32 bit Intel, 64 bit Intel), and you can conceivably remove 32 bit Intel. The only Intel Macs shipped that do not support 64 bit userspace are the original MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and MacBook 2006. You can use a program like Xslimmer to do this.

*All frameworks are installed 3 way fat (32 bit and 64 bit Intel, and 32 bit PPC). The PPC bits are there for Rosetta even if you do not have the emulator installled. You can remove PPC if you are not going to use any appc apps. Again, Xslimmer does this.

*All Mac OS X installs include the complete set of drivers necessary for all Macs supported by that OS at the time it shipped. A number of drives may not be necessary for your particular Machine, and could be trimmed out, but doing so is moderately complicated.

*If you have multiple localization installed you can remove them. Xslimmer can do this, as can Monolingual.

*If"|"yo are really gutsy you can build an mkext and delete OS X's drivers directory entirely. An mkext is a bundle of kexts generally used as part of netbooting, but the bootloader can use it to boot off a normal disk as well. It will omit any driver not needed to boot a system, and be trimmed down to a single architecture. On my system that would save ~300MB. If the full drivers aren't there, then some devices might not work, but anything needed to boot should be.

*You can start deleting programs in /Applications, but the system assumes those are there, some stuff may not work properly.

*Disk Utility by default leaves extra space for certain things on drives larger than a certain size. It is documented here. On a 4GB drive there there is ~328 MBs lost that way.
200MB of it is for the ESP partition. The ESP is scratch space used under rare circumstances for the boot process. Removing it might cause difficulties installing firmware updates, but it probably won't, and you probably won't notice it.
There is also 128MB of unformatted space after the HFS+ partition. That is that there to aid in LVM operations (resizing partitions), and may be necessary in certain edge cases when running the installer (if the installer needs a chunk of contiguous space for something that is not a normal file during an OS upgrade, and it can't find the space within the FS it can extend it). You can probably get rid of it, but it might make it difficult to run the installer directly against the drive. Of course, given what you have to do to get 10.6 onto the drive, the odds that you could just run a 10.7 updater against when that comes out seem very low anyway.
In order to layout the drive this way you will need to hand build the partition map with the commandline gpt tool.
Having said that, the above will probably not trim down OS X enough to fit into a 4GB flash drive. Even if it did, OS X needs some temporary space (a couple hundred megs) to work, and by default that is on the boot drive. While it is conceivable you could write a boot script to find a drive inside the system and use it for temp space (point /private/tmp there, and setting the up the default pager), that is moderately complicated. I am guessing this is a recovery drive for a lab or something, in which case you don't want this install to perturb drives in the system it boots. If you need to boot on a range of machines it also means trimming out drivers is substantially more complicated and limited.
Ultimately, you are much better off just buying a 8GB flash drive. That is large enough to clone a normal installation, and will save you days of work.

A: I don't know what the absolute minimum is. Isn't it written on the DVD box?
However, there are obviously stuff that you can remove from the install to regain several hundred megabytes. I'm not sure you can fit Snow Leopard in 4 GB, though. 8 GB should be feasible.


*

*Additional languages and application architectures are not necessary and are pretty huge (string them using Monolingual or something like that);

*The iLife apps (GarageBand, iPhoto, iMovie & iMovie HD, iDVD) and iTunes score more than 1 GB together;


There are probably many more you can strip off. My call would be to make another partition on your primary drive (maybe 15-20 GB), install Mac OS there and try to remove stuff until it gets under 4 GB. Then, copy it to your drive with Carbon Copy Cloner and it should be bootable.

A: Another factor no one thinks about is how much RAM you have in your computer, because if you have 2GB RAM, a bootable USB drive with Mac OS X is going to create a 2GB virtual memory swap file on the drive. It will be stored in
/private/var/vm/sleepimage

You can delete this file but the next time your reboot, it will be re-created. 
If you run the same USB drive on a computer with 8GB of RAM, its' going to try to create an 8GB swap file. So your 4GB installation could balloon to 12GB of disk space the first time you use it.
There is a method out there somewhere to permanently disable the sleepimage file. This means that whenever you boot from the USB drive, it will only use RAM and will not cache the contents of ram to the sleepimage file. This might have an adverse effect on system performance, but you will be able to run your system on a smaller USB drive.

A: I just scanned /Library and /System and /usr with GrandPerspective to find big files. Here is my findings:
662 Mb /Library/Printers
 52 Mb /Library/Fonts/STHeiti Medium.ttc
 58 Mb /Library/Dictionaries/Shogakukan Progressive English-Japanese...
382 Mb /System/Library/Speech/Voices/Alex.SpeechVoice
 52 Mb /System/Library/Fonts/STHeiti Light.ttc
 34 Mb /System/Library/Fonts/Aqua Kana.ttc

In total 1.2 Gb. I guess these files can be safely deleted if it's for an USB stick.

A: When installing Mac OS 10.6 ""Snow Leopard"" you can click ""Customize"" and remove Printer Support, Additional Fonts, Language Translations, Rosetta, X11 and Quicktime. That eliminates 3+ GB and leaves 'Essential System Software' which requires 8.01 GB. 
If you want to get it on a smaller drive you won't be able to use the Install CD. You'll have to delete even more and then make an exact copy."|"Q: Is it possible to reduce the disk space required to install Mac OS X 10.6? I was hoping to install Mac OS X on a flash-based drive I have, but it's only 4GB. The installer tells me there's not enough free space, but it doesn't specify how much I need free.


*

*Does anyone know the exact minimum?

*Is it possible to create a custom install with only the bare basics and install within 4GB?


A: I can answer the second question, but not the first.
The minimum install that comes off the DVD is ~6 gigabytes. If you want to make a smaller install, the easiest thing to do is install it on another partition, trim down the installation, then copy it over to the target drive using ditto or Carbon Copy Cloner.
Though I do not recommend doing any of these, there are a couple of thing installed in the default system that can be trimmed out to save space:


*

*All app binaries are installed 2 way fat (32 bit Intel, 64 bit Intel), and you can conceivably remove 32 bit Intel. The only Intel Macs shipped that do not support 64 bit userspace are the original MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and MacBook 2006. You can use a program like Xslimmer to do this.

*All frameworks are installed 3 way fat (32 bit and 64 bit Intel, and 32 bit PPC). The PPC bits are there for Rosetta even if you do not have the emulator installalled. You can remove PPC if you are not going to use any appc apps. Again, Xslimmer does this.

*All Mac OS X installs include the complete set of drivers necessary for all Macs supported by that OS at the time it shipped. A number of drives may not be necessary for your particular Machine, and could be trimmed out, but doing so is moderately complicated.

*If you have multiple localization installed you can remove them. Xslimmer can do this, as can Monolingual.

*If you have a Mac that does not support 64 bit, you can remove all 64 bit installs. This includes the 64 bit installer itself.

*If you have an Intel Mac that does not support 32 bit, you can remove all 32 bit installs. This includes the 32 bit installer itself.

*If you have an Intel Mac that supports 64 bit but does not support 32 bit, you can remove the 32 bit installer.

*If you have an Intel Mac that supports 64 bit and 32 bit, and you want to remove 32 bit support, you can remove the 32 bit installer.

*If you have an Intel Mac that supports 64 bit and 32 bit, and you want to remove 64 bit support, you can remove the 64 bit installer.

*If you have an Intel Mac that supports 64 bit and 32 bit, and you want to remove both 64 bit and 32 bit support, you can remove the 64 bit and 32 bit installers.

*If you have an Intel Mac that supports 64 bit and 32 bit, and you want to remove 64 bit support but keep 32 bit support, you can remove the 64 bit installer but keep the 32 bit installer.

*If you have an Intel Mac that supports 64 bit but does not support 32 bit, and you want to remove 32 bit support, you can remove the 32 bit installer but keep the 64 bit installer.

As far as the iPhone making facetime calls, the only easy way I've seen to do it is to already have their Facetime address in your Address Book, or use Safari.

So when someone facetimes my AppleID, it rings on my iPhone, Mac, and iPad all at the same time, allowing me to answer it wherever I am at that moment.
I didn't do anything special to set this up... just went into FaceTime under Settings, and added the email address(es) I wanted people to be able to reach me on.  Works fine.

A: Calendar alarms obey the mute switch.  Clock alarms do not.

I also appreciate if you have other usefull methods to overcome this obstacle. An example would be dynamic links where you could specify the path with a wildcard a for example:
If my two disks are named Backup_Disk_A and Backup_Disk_B then I would create this alias
ln -s /Volumes/Backup_Disk_%

The problem here is that when I change the disk then the link can't find the destination.

A: So I managed to get a solution. 
You have to name your external disks which you want to swap with the exact same name (to be able to differentiate them just write different names on the cases). Then you insert one disk and share it as a time machine destination. Now go to the clients and select your shared time machine destination disk. When Time Machine has done its backup you can swap the external HD with the second one. 
Time machine on the clients will not notice that the destination drive has been swapped, neither will the server (it seems that the shared time machine destination points to the HD name and not as expected to the HD GUID).

803||"Q: Are there any performance limitations when running a VM of a Boot Camp installation? I'm planning on installing Windows on my Mac, and would like to be able to use both Boot Camp (for when I need to be able to use all of the hardware of the computer) and a virtual machine (for those times when I don't want to restart).
I noticed that both VMWare Fusion and Parallels allow you to set up a virtual machine which uses the Boot Camp installation, which is exactly what I want because I want to have one installation of all the programs.
However, I'm wondering if using a virtual machine with the Boot Camp installation has the same exact performance as creating a brand new virtual machine.
The thing that prompted me to think that they might not have the same performance is the marketing text on VMware Fusion's website:

Boot Camp Improvements — Up to 5x faster disk performance with Boot Camp virtual machines and a new option to disable authentication.

... which I understood to"|"mean that, in the past, a normal virtual machine (i.e. one that doesn't use Boot Camp) was faster than one that uses a Boot Camp installation, and now with the upgrade, it's 5x faster... yet it's still not as fast as the normal virtual machine (since then they would probably mention that it's now as fast as a traditional virtual machine).
Is there a performance difference when using a normal virtual machine vs. one that uses a Boot Camp installation in VMware Fusion or Parallels? If so, which one is faster and by how much?
Update: Since there are two attributes to compare, the wording is a bit confusing.
For clarification, let:

A = Performance of normal VM on VMware Fusion 3
  B = Performance of Boot Camp VM on VMware Fusion 3
  C = Performance of normal VM on VMware Fusion 2
  D = Performance of Boot Camp VM on VMware Fusion 2 

I understood the marketing text to mean B = D * 5, and I inferred A > B since they mention that Boot Camp needed improvements, and rather than saying it's now as fast as a normal VM, they give a ""5x"" figure.

A: As I use it on regular basis I can say it's good performance of using Bootcamp installed windows via VMWare Fusion 3.
Here is process I followed.


*

*Make a bootcamp partition using Bootcamp Assistant for the space.

*Install the Windows XP version.

*Open the VMware and select the bootcamp partition, when you create a new virtual machine for Windows.

*VMWare installs few utilities on the bootcamp partition, to use it to boot via Fusion.

*Once all this is done, you can launch this windows version like a normal virtual machine in Fusion.


If I want a lite usage of windows I will boot via Fusion, if I want to run heavy programs then I will boot into Bootcamp, but I rarely does it, as Fusion VM is 99% OK for me for all activities including development with Eclipse.

A: A Boot Camp VM is slower for two reasons: the NTFS driver used is slower than whatever a normal VM uses, and also, the Boot Camp partition is placed on the innermost (slowest) section of the hard drive platters. 

A: I have exactly the same question, and have yet to find a good answer. In the past (before Fusion 3.1), I understand that a virtual disk was generally faster, because: a) this could take advantage of host cacheing, etc. and b) Fusion still had to tunnel through the host OS to access the Boot Camp partition, since the hard drive is really ""owned"" and managed by the host. I'm not sure what changed in 3.1 to increase the performance by 5x, but apparently it can now access the BC partition much more efficiently.
In my case, I actually have a second physical hard drive in my Mac Pro that is dedicated to Windows. So, theoretically, Windows could talk directly to this hard drive without going through the host OS at all. I'm not sure that Fusion is actually able to recognize this special case and do that, but it would be awesome if it did, similar to the way the guest OS can ""own"" certain USB devices."|"mean that using a virtual machine with the Boot Camp installation would have better performance than a virtual machine created from scratch.

A: A workaround that I found, is to go to iTunes Music library, find the voice memo, and then manually delete it from there. After you sync, the Voice Memo playlist will be deleted from underneath your iPhone (in iTunes), so you won't see that file that had an exclamation mark anymore.

Right now it displays only n tabs and the remaining are only accessible through a >> button.
How can I display all tabs at once without needing to scroll horizontally? Can tabs be set to shrink to a much smaller size, to display more at once?

A: Actually there is a plugin (not to be confused with an extension) called"|"Glims which allows the tabs to have a minimum width roughly the size of the close button. It's free - Glims
The screen resolution you are set to will ultimately determine your results, but for me I can normally only fit 13 tabs in a full screen Safari window. With Glims installed and this option turned on, it fits around 50 tabs. After that it resumes the usual behavior of giving you the >> for more tabs.
The drawback is obviously you loose your tab titles, making it difficult to discern one tab from another and this is why Apple chose to impose this arbitrary limitation. However there is another feature in Glims to display the website's favicon in the place where the close tab button usually is. This helps alleviate the aforementioned dilemma to an extent.
FYI - Glims does much more than that as well.

A: You can also try those following keys: Cmd + Shift + T but also chose go to view"" Show Tab Bar.
If you are looking for a fresh app I recommand you to try the sweet Tabexposé which works for Leopard as well as Snow Leopard

A: It sounds as if you already know you can click on the » to see the additional tabs.
Outside of that, your only other option is to make the browser window wider.

I have always been told that there is no equivalent on Mac.  
What would be the best alternative?
Some details about pros/cons, missing features, cool tips would be appreciated.
I will make this question community wiki.

A: Blogo, which was discontinued earlier, is back again. If you are on a Mac looking for a blog editor app, you should try it. You can download the beta for free at:
http://www.getblogo.com
There is also a cross platform solution called BlueGriffon that looks promising.
My current recommendation and favorite is Blogo.

Easily publish text, images, videos, slideshows and more. 
  With a simple, intuitive interface and support for Wordpress, Blogger, Typepad, Typo, Drupal, Joomla, and Expression Engine, Blogo is the best 
  way to maintain your blog and spread the word with Twitter, Ping.fm and other supported services.

It also supports Twitter.
The closest to WLW would be Ecto, but active development seems to have stopped.

A: I have"|"heard great things about MarsEdit, but have never used it myself. One that I have used quite a bit is MacJournal, which I know has blog-publishing support (in addition to functioning as a journal and/or notebook, which is what I mostly use it for). Without having put a lot of effort into figuring it out, I do feel like formatting posts can be a bit of a hassle in MacJournal, but I have used it for LJ publishing with okay results. All in all, I have probably heard more good things about MarsEdit for blog-publishing, but figured MacJournal deserved being mentioned, at least, as an alternative.

A: Byword 2
In Byword 2, you can publish your Markdown content directly to blogs such as WordPress (both self-hosted and WordPress.com), and Tumblr.


A: Qumana

This simple desktop editing tool allows you to write and save posts to your hard drive, while also posting to any of your blogs, anywhere. Never lose a post again.

Thingamablog

A cross-platform (Linux, Mac, Windows), standalone blogging application that makes authoring and publishing your weblogs almost effortless. Unlike most blogging solutions, Thingamablog does NOT require a third-party blogging host, a cgi/php enabled web host, or a MySQL database. In fact, all you need to setup, and manage, a blog with Thingamablog is FTP, SFTP, or network access to a web server.

PixelPumper

With PixelPumper, you can now create, edit and publish your blog posts directly from OS X in a beautiful retina display interface. It doesn't matter if you host your blog on WordPress.com or self-host, PixelPumper allows you to post to either.

Just like Live Writer helps you update your WordPress blogs easily while still being inside your desktop environment and not opening the browser. The app is available for free in the Mac App Store and measures only about 4.8 MB in size.
Edit
Also of interest is Ghost:
More information about it can be seen from its Kickstarter campaign and Official website.

A: If you are using Markdown, you can try WordMark. It supports publishing to Wordpress, Ghost, Evernote, Blogger, and so on.. 


A: One of the best applications is MarsEdit (40$) by Red Sweater Software.
It supports many blog types (including Tumblr), and allows both HTML and Rich Text editing.
I think it also allows editing Wordpress pages and not only blog posts.
It handles image uploading, editing of posts and supports multiple blogs.
Some of the cons of MarsEdit are its HTML editing shortcuts and macros which are a little uncomfortable and a bit too little.
If you're comfortable with HTML, then the known TextMate text editor can also be used as an editor for blog posts and then you can either copy/paste from there or use a blogging bundle which will let you upload from there. TextMate can also show you live preview of your HTML in a separate window.
Of course, being a specialized application, MarsEdit is more feature rich in the blogging sense but TextMate has a better editor (obviously).

A: SmartXBlog is desktop blog editor for both Windows and Mac. It has WYSIWYG editor, image editor, online content search and RSS feed available from nearly 100 popular websites and you can even add your own RSS and drag and drop your result to editor.

811||"Q: Automatically quit Terminal when typing exit Scenario
I use terminal to SSH a lot, however would like the Terminal App to quit when the last Tab closes using exit. I already have the terminal window itself set to close on successful exit, however Terminal keeps running. I followed Ricky Campbell's tutorial here which uses an AppleScript to quit terminal. The AppleScript works perfectly when running outside of Terminal, however I somehow can't get the trap command to work that needs to be placed in the terminal.
For reference I will post the relevant text here:

Now we need a way to kickoff the script. This can be done with the bash command “trap”, having it listen for the EXIT signal. Since I want this to happen everytime my user opens a shell, I add it to my .profile file. I do this with nano:
$ nano ~/.profile
In this file add the following somewhere. You may need to edit the path to the AppleScript file you created earlier:
trap '/usr/bin/osascript $HOME/Scripts/QuitTerminal.scpt' EXIT
All this does is listen for the EXIT signal within bash and when it gets it, runs the script we created earlier.

Question
How do I go about troubleshooting this problem. For some reason the trap is"|"not firing or working the way it should, even after numerous reboots. Is there an alternative way to get the Terminal App to close when the last tab exits?
Solution
The links provided by Dori led to the solution. The article suggest that the trap command should be in .profile, when in fact it has to be placed in .bashrc. Moving it to the correct script fixed the problem.

A: The approach given here looks a little simpler—maybe it would work for you?

If you don't want to remember to type ""quit"" instead of ""exit"", and you're using bash, just add the following to your .bashrc or other shell startup script:
trap '/usr/bin/osascript -e ""tell application \""terminal\"" to quit""' 0

What's it do? When the shell receives signal 0 (zero), that is, told to exit, it will execute this command as the last thing it does. This allows your shell, etc, to exit gracefully, and asking Terminal.app to exit via applescript makes sure it does the same. In other words, type 'exit', and your shell exits, then Terminal quits, all cleanly and the way nature intended.

The full thread can be found here.

A: You can also use this convoluted command, which does not trigger a warning about terminating its own process:
osascript -e ""do shell script \""osascript -e \\\""tell application \\\\\\\""Terminal\\\\\\\"" to quit\\\"" &> /dev/null &\""""; exit

Or, you could define an alias (such as quit or exit) in your profile:
alias quit='osascript -e ""do shell script \""osascript -e \\\""tell application \\\\\\\""Terminal\\\\\\\"" to quit\\\"" &> /dev/null &\""""; exit'


A: You does not need trap any signal.
Simply, put the osascript command into your ~/.bash_logout file (create it, if does not exists)
osascript -e ""tell application \""Terminal\"" to quit""

The .bash_logout is executed by bash after you logging out. You can enter any shell command into this file, each will executed when you logging out. 
For example, you can open a Finder window in the folder where you was last, before exit, with open . or like...
open .
say ""Good bye, my master - leaving terminal now, continue with Finder""
osascript -e ""tell application \""Terminal\"" to quit""

and so on...

A: I find this url for multi tabed Terminal case. 
http://cyberdork33.wordpress.com/2010/05/25/make-osx-terminal-quit-when-last-window-closed/
just tested on os x 10.8.2
TL.DR:
for the tab part(exit to close current tab)
Terminal > Preferences > Settings > Shell
When the shell exits: Close if the shell exited cleanly (or Close the window)
Prompt before closing:  Never(or Only if there are processes other than the logins shell and: Insert ""osascript"")
for the last tab part(exit to close this last tab and whole terminal windows and quit Terminal.app):
1) append to ~/.bash_profile:  
trap '/usr/bin/osascript $HOME/Scripts/QuitTerminal.scpt' EXIT

2) create Scripts/QuitTerminal.scpt
tell application ""Terminal""
    # If there is only one tab remaining, and it contains the word ""logout""
    # then this is the final window
    if (count of (tabs of (every window whose visible is true))) = 1 then

812||Q: Installing applications from disk images - what about the resources? I know that the way to install an application on Mac is to drag the icon from the disk image onto applications. Often these folders don't just contain an application but resources (such as a readme as well). How do I then access these resources later? Do I have to save the disk images as well? This seems kind of silly as then the default instructions for installing the|"application mean that you can't easily access the readme later (as the disk image has probably been saved to the downloads folder where it will eventually end up being deleted).

A: What I do in these cases (which I seem to run into fairly often lately) is create a new folder in Applications, and then drag everything from the disk image into that folder. It's one extra level, but it works just fine for almost every application.

A: As you have correctly guessed, those resources won’t be available unless the application provided an installer and/or a folder (for example World of Warcraft is a big folder with lots of things in there). 
If the application is just a bundle you have to drag (like most), if you want to access any resource in the disk image at a later time, you will have to save it. There’s no other automatic way. 
On the other hand if the application is a simple bundle you have to drag, there isn’t much “install instructions” you really need. When you don’t need the application anymore, you drag it to the trash. 
Some applications include more stuff in the Disk Images, generating this type of confusion, but most software doesn’t have this problem, because it either has a pkg installer or a simple icon you have to drag and nothing more. 

A: Things alongside the .app are sometimes aliases, sometimes duplicates of things within the .app"|application would be to just copy the application to the applications folder. But I guess that's not possible. A: Great question! The best way to install applications from disk images is to just drag the application icon to the applications folder. This will copy the application and all its resources to the applications folder, so you don't have to save the disk image. If you want to access the resources later, just double-click on the application icon. The resources will be included in the application folder. Hope this helps!|0.3316569924354553|0.1935483870967742
813||"Q: No video from Mac Mini, ONLY once OS X has loaded I have an old G4 Mac Mini, running 10.5. It's hooked up to a VGA CRT monitor using Apples DVI-to-VGA adapter that was included once upon a time. Last night, while using it, the screen flickered, and the monitor went to sleep, which is it;s default behavior when there's no display connected to it. Attempting to force the monitor on displayed a ""No Signal"" error. Restarting the machine does nothing.
This has happened once before. The last time this happened, I attempted to fix it by resetting the PRAM. After doing this, the Mac output the standard grey screen with an Apple logo on startup, but when the system reached the OS X login screen, the monitor flickers and goes black. Attempting to boot in Safe Mode provides similar results. The Monitor is old enough that it does not offer an ""Out of Range"" error for unsupported refresh rates, but I took a chance and attempted the Single User Mode directions found in this Knowledge Base article, to delete windowserver.plist files."|"The last time this happened (about 6 months ago), that worked perfectly.
Last night, the same problem occurred, with the same symptoms. Does not display video in Safe Mode. Does display video in Single User Mode. However, after deleting the two windowserver.plist files, the machine is still unable to display video past the grey startup screen.
Is there anything else I can try to fix this? Is the DVI-to-VGA adapter a possible culprit for a cheap fix? Or is my Mini in need of enough repair as to be better off replaced?
Edit: It's definitely not the DVI to VGA adapter, sadly.

A: The 1st thing you have to do is try to determine if it’s merely a software issue with your OS install or if the problem relies on the hardware (whether it’s the screen or the computer itself). 
In order to facilitate that task, you must check the obvious. 
1) The DVI adapter (already tested).
2) The Screen. Can you hook the monitor to another computer?
3) Can you hook another monitor to the same computer?
Extras: Have you tried another VGA cable? 
The above should result in any of the following:
a) The screen is defective, change screen.
b) The Mac mini has a hardware issue where no other screen works. Time for repairs (probably not worth).
c) The Cable is defective, change cable.
d) The screen works fine on another computer, the Mac mini works fine with another display. what…?
In case of D, there could be a problem with the software instead, either the driver that the Mac mini is using when it detects the display is broken or the video driver or something. That’s a whole new world and -as already suggested- you might want to try booting from the install CD/DVD and trying to see if video works there. Back up your drive and a full reinstall might also help you have everything fresh.
Hope it helps. I know it’s a lot of obvious steps, but this is how the tech guys do it :) Find the problem first.
UPDATE:
After reading that the Mac mini doesn’t work with a different screen and that this issue happens before login screen (i.e. it’s not ‘user’ related), there are two possible ideas you can try before a complete OS reinstall.
You mention that it works in Single User but not safe mode; given that Single User goes straight to the command line, have you tried running fsck on the partition? Maybe there’s some data corruption in the OS X volume. 
Safe Mode doesn’t load external drivers and items in the StartupFolders, so that should work and I find it weird that it doesn’t. Of course make sure you unplug all external devices (sans keyboard/mouse/display) before diagnosing a problem like this. 
In any case, I’d try to install a fresh copy of OS X on an external drive (if you don’t want to wipe your internal copy) and see what happens from there. If the external copy works, then the OS X copy has a big problem. I know this is obvious (and it’s already in your list of things to do) but sadly debugging a problem like this without access to the OS/hardware is really hard. You can always later clone the freshly installed OS X to your internal drive to avoid the reinstall in the internal drive.
Good Luck!"|"Q: No video from Mac Mini, ONLY once OS X has loaded. I have an old G4 Mac Mini, running 10.5.

814||"Q: Do you have a better way to browse Windows 7 machines in Finder (SL 10.6.5)? Browsing the ""network neighborhood"" in OS X Finder does show XP machines, but not Windows 7 machines. (Vista machines have a similar problem). I can connect manually to Windows 7 machines (""connect to server"" and then specifying ""smb://ip_or_name""), but want to be able to browse Win 7 machines automatically.
Browsing works if security is lowered on the Windows 7 machines, and the OS X machine is forced to be the master browser. Question: Who has a better solution? I would like to find another solution without having to change OS X and all Windows 7 machines. Maybe you know some extra OS X software that ""makes samba just work right""?

A: Windows 7 has extra network security options, and one of them sets its discoverability. By default in Windows 7, when you connect to a new network you are prompted for what type of network it should be: Public, Work, or Home. These profiles set up the firewall and security options when on that network; I can't off the top of my head list all"|"the things they specifically set up, but when you select Public, sharing and discoverability are locked tight, whereas in Home they are more relaxed.
It's very likely that you have set your network type to Public on your Windows 7 computer. If you open the Network and Sharing Center, under the name of your active network it should say either ""Home network"", ""Work network"" or ""Public network"". If it is indeed set to Public (or Work), click it and then click Home network. You shouldn't have any problems after that.
Alternatively, you can open the start menu and type Network and hit enter. This opens the Network window, which lets you browse other computers on your network. As soon as the window opens, a yellow bar should appear at the top informing you that network discoverability is turned off; click the bar and then click one of the resolution options. This may fix the problem as well.
I haven't had any problem in OS X connecting to my Windows 7 computers that are set to Home network, as they should be. But a Windows 7 computer set to Public network should be basically undetectable.

A: The Non-Ideal Solution
After reading a lot of hints, lowering the required client security on the Windows and making the OS X machine the master browser works reliably for me. However, this solution is less than ideal, as it requires reconfiguring the Mac and every Win 7 computer.
Steps
Changes to Windows 7:


*

*change the security policy. Using  secpol.msc, go to local security, security options and find ""Network security: 
Minimum session security for NTLM-SSP based..."" both for client and server.
(sorry, may be different, I have a German install).

*

*uncheck ""NTLMv2 session security required""

*leave ""128 encryption required"" checked.



128 bit encryption works with Snow Leopard. Unchecking it is required for some older versions of OS X.
Changes to OS X Snow Leopard:


*

*edit /private/etc/smb.conf

*locate ""os level = 2"" and change to ""os level = 99"" which makes this samba always win

*locate ""domain master = no"" on next line and change to ""domain master = yes""


Starting the new configuration:


*

*shut down your OS X and disconnect or shut down all your Windows clients.

*restart OS X. This way, OS X will become the master browser for samba.

*restart or reconnect your Windows clients.


The Very Simple Solution
By using OS X Server (properly configured), browsing will ""just work"", without the need to reconfigure anything else.


*

*Get OS X server.

*Configure SMB as Standalone Server

*

*enable Workgroup Master Browser

*enable Domain Master Browser

*enable WINS server


*under Access, allow NTLMv2 & Kerberos, NTLM, LAN Manager   (according to what your minimum security should be)


This may be more than necessary, but it made the situation unambigous.
The problem is circumvented. It is not a principal problem of OS X Server, which uses the same Samba build as OS X client. It works reliable with the server solution. Since there is rather little interest in this topic, I will not further investigate, sorry.
About the server cost: It is quite pricey. If you happen to be registered as an Apple Developer, then you can run an evaluation copy of OS X server."|"Q: Do you have a better way to browse Windows 7 machines in Finder (SL 10.6.5)?

A: Which kind of buttons are you talking about?
If you want to customize your toolbar by adding or removing existing buttons:


*

*Right-click in the Finder toolbar and select Customize Toolbar… from the context menu

*Drag the buttons you want in or out, and place them where you want them.

*Click Done.

If you want to add new buttons that aren't shipped by"|"Apple:


*

*Just drag them into the toolbar.

Hmm, can't post image, so you will have to use your imagination :-(
Or wait, nm, they just can't be inline:
[EDIT] okay, now it can be inline

I started using OS X back in 10.1, well before the sidebar came out, so that's the way I used to get around. To add these, drag the item to the toolbar (when you're not running the toolbar customization sheet. Adding a separator bar from the customization sheet will make dragging things to the toolbar easier (aim for the divider, then the Finder will know you want to add the item to the toolbar, rather than, say, copy the item to your Applications folder).
A couple of other tips if you weren't already aware of these. Hold down Command-Option and click on the toggle-toolbar button (the oblong button in the upper right) to immediately invoke the customization sheet.
You can also hold down the Command key to allow manipulation of the toolbar items without having to use the customization sheet. For example, if I no longer want my Apps folder in the toolbar, hold down Command and drag it out of the toolbar and release, and it will poof 
like when you remove an app from the Dock. Or, you can hold down the Command key and drag the toolbar items to the left or right to rearrange them.
Also, hold down the Command key and press the toggle-toolbar button to cycle through the different toolbar viewing modes (for example, text or icons, and large or small size, etc.)."|"Apple:

820||"Q: Why does my MacBook Pro reach high temperatures when running? I have my MacBook Pro sitting on my desk and it's consistently over 160 degrees. It is almost too hot to touch in some places on the casing.

A: 160 degrees Fahrenheit, if it is CPU temperature, is normal for MBP. 
MBPs are designed to run pretty hot, with the aluminum case as the main heatsink the casing gets uncomfortably hot sometimes.
If you want to remedy the problem:


*

*use a laptop stand (I use Belkin Cushtops, they are really comfortable), 

*put your laptop on steady, heat-transducing surface (human skin, blankets or soft chairs are bad — wooden/plastic/metallic tables are good),

*open up the casing and clean the dust (can make it ~10 degrees Celcius"|"cooler)

*or, use less video- or CPU-intensive application =)


A: If you're interested, I've had a lot of luck manually regulating my MBP's temperature a little better with smcfancontrol.  I find that keeping the fans running at 3,000 RPM by default (instead of the normal 1,000) adds no ambient noise over what's already in my office and keeps the temperature a bit lower.  I also use it to pre-emptively turn the fans up to 6,000 RPM when I know I'm about to do something that will make it run hot.

A: That is within range. The chips can run up to 205*F according to the people at my local Apple store (I had the same question).
There is a thermal trigger if it gets too hot that will yank power to the computer. Real pain when you're working on something and don't notice the heat output.

A: Short answer: because of the crappy nVidia chip in it. See here for more details and don't forget to use some sort of app to see your actual temperature details. You'll see it's the GPU diode that's burning up. The rest should be hunky dory, at least 12 degrees centigrade below that piece of... extraordinary nVidia technology which I will forever remember for this snafu.
Long answer: I currently have one of those pre-Unibody 17"" MBPs, with the faulty nVidias. Oh yeah, I'm so happy, I can hardly hold it in.
It initially ran at about 75 degrees Centigrade when I used it. After putting it on a smcfancontrol diet and keeping the fans revved up to 4500 as a default, everything was hunky dory except it still ran at about 69 degrees and was burning my forearms (though I love it in the winter).
Long story short: bought a wireless keyboard, turned the fans down to their standard 2000, 4 weeks later I'm the proud owner of an MBP with a dead nVidia chip on it. Luckily, I had Apple Care so everything was fixed literally without any questions. The new logic board had the gpu diode running at 63 degrees for the first two weeks (with fans turned down). Now their default has become 72 degrees with the fans at 4000. I think I'm going to turn smcfancontrol off, make the default 2000 again and let it burn.
I wonder how many dead nVidias I have to get in so that Apple replaces my notebook with a version that doesn't have a crappy nVidia card in it."|"cooler).


A: I think that's a pretty good answer! I'd just add that if you want to mitigate the problem, you could try putting your laptop on a heat-reducing surface, like a heat-absorbing mat or a blanket. And if you're worried about the CPU temperature, you could also try cleaning the CPU with a cloth to remove the dust that might be causing the problem."|0.33656609058380127|0.09861932938856016

I was hoping (and thinking) there would be an IP address that I could use regardless of where I am at.

A: Have you tried 'machinename.local?' (eg mymac.local)
I have a similar setup (and many many variations thereof) and usually the Windows VM can see the Mac via the address 'millie.local', where millie is the machine name.

I had a headless Linux desktop that I used to poll my Time Machine and graph network statistics off of, but that computer is currently undergoing repairs, so I'm left with the remaining computers I have in the house, which are all Mac.
I have no specific requirements that I consider as a sticking point. My baseline of features would be something with the granularity that Cacti/RRDTool provide. Graphs with scalable units of time/history (configurable is a plus!), quick/easy to get started with little installation is preferable, something that perhaps just runs as a daemon/program and doesn't require a web server and detailed tailored configuration (read: discovery) would be just fine, and possibly even"|"preferred.

A: Unfortunately I'm not aware of any serious competition to Cacti, but have you considered using a Cacti virtual appliance? There are several pre-configured VMs available with everything pre-installed and ready to go.

You might also want to take a look here:
A Half-Dozen or So Essential Open Source Network Administraton Tools
and in particular at:
Graph Network Performance with NRG - Part 1
He also has a page on how to install Cacti on OS X.
Now I can't say that this meets your desire for something as simple as a typical OS X application install but it certainly meets the free requirement.
I can't say I've played with any of these tools on OS X bar Mac Ports which I consider an essential on any OS X system.
Another really simplistic app (OS X widget actually) is iEyeNet, it definitely meets the free and simple criteria but isn't anywhere as configurable as Cacti. I tried it with my Airport Extreme and it ""just worked"".
Another option is documented here, it uses a combination of MRTG/Lingon/Geektool to generate and display the network graphs. Reasonably easy to setup...

A: I know this is an old topic and also I'm aware of how sensitive recommending one's own application can be (especially in case of a commercial application), however I think this does answer the OP's question exactly. If this is not allowed (I tried looking for a policy in the FAQ), please let me know and I will take this down. 
I've been looking for such application for OSX myself. I couldn't really find one (except for the afore mentioned iEyeNet, which didn't meet my requirements) and so I've decided to write one myself, which gave me the opportunity to learn a bit of Objective-C. 
I call it iNetGrapher. I think it will meet your requirements although it's not free. It's very simple to install (essentially get it on Mac App Store), doesn't require a web server or any other service / daemon / dependent software, it does autodiscovery of all interfaces on a supported network device / server and it lets you simultaneously graph traffic from multiple interfaces and multiple devices. It supports SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, and in the latter case, both 32-bit and 64-bit counters. 
There is also a free, good alternative, although it is command line only - it might fit your needs though. It's called ttg - you'll need to open this page and scroll down till you find it, or download the source from here: ttg.c. This one has been written by a good friend of mine. 
I hope this is useful. I've been genuinely trying to help here and not promote my app.

One day I accidentally deleted it from device and then was able to download it from Appstore for free (as I ""had the previous version"" of that app). 
So now I just wonder are there limits for that (number of devices I can do that on, any time limits etc)?

So is it a guaranteed behavior at all?.. 

A: As long as its the same app, then you should be able to do this as many times as needed. Also, once you have that app, you have it even if the price changes, goes from free to paid or vice versa. 
One thing that I have seen happen in the app store, is developers releasing a whole new version of their app, and naming it differently,  launching it differently. A perfect example of it is Tweetie. When they went to version 2, he re-released it as a new app (Tweetie 2), therefore making anyone who wanted to get the new one to have to pay (even if they paid for the first). Then, that app was converted to free and changed to Twitter for iPhone, but if you bought Tweetie 2, you just got an update that changed it. 

A:

A: You don't say what you'll be using them for.  I'm (among other things) a programmer, and for me being able to see a tall vertical area in my text editor is of primary importance.  Thus, given 2 widescreen monitors, I'd set them up vertically, next to each other.
I'm not unique here: when I visited Google, most of the programmers I saw had this layout too.
I would think this could help with your neck problem, since it makes the display area closer to a square, and not a really wide rectangle.  Alternatively, you could keep them horizontal, and stack one right above the other.  Depends on the shape of the things you're going to be looking at most, I guess!

A: Honestly, I've been using 2 24inch monitors for years (one  24ich connected to my 24inch iMac).  I personally think using two monitors is  not necessary anymore, if you effectively use spaces/virtual desktops.  
I now only use my 24inch iMac as my only display, and basically just got used to the new setup, while mastering the keyboard shortcuts.  I don't need to move my head, the OS does it for me.
I say ditch the other monitor and get use to using cntrl+arrow keys, just my opinion.

A: Make sure both are at the same height, if you still have neck strain, then you are not sitting at the right level:

(image courtesy of this link).
If you put them higher or lower, you’ll have to adjust with your neck, thus causing strain.
An excellent blog post about that was written by our own creator…
LCD Monitor Arms. Good old school post.

A: Ergonomics in a nutshell: The heuristic is to have your eye line be about 1-2"" below the top of your monitor.  That should allow your arms to be roughly parallel to your desk and your back perpendicular to the base of your chair."|"Q: What is the best way to use two 27"" monitors on your desk?

EDIT: responses so far have focused on having the monitors at the right level, i.e. at and below eye level.

Ideally I'd like to have one monitor at eye level, and one at a slight angle (maybe 30 degrees) so I can see both easily without having to move my head. I've tried putting the monitors on stands, but that makes it hard to see the upper monitor, and the angle is still not ideal.

The retail stores only sell the standard configurations of their products. When looking at the specs for ""What's in the Box"" for an iMac, it includes a Magic Mouse. They'd have to open up the box and take out the mouse while giving you the separately packaged Magic Trackpad.
You're best chance is getting the Magic Trackpad thrown in at a discount."|bundle. I'm curious if anyone has taken advantage of this offer and what their experience has been with the bundled mice and trackpad.

834||"Q: Mobile Me Family Pack Accounts: Do Sub-Accounts have their own syncing features? Merry Christmas.
In a MobileMe Family Pack, do the subaccounts have their own, independent syncing features (dock, bookmarks, etc - as seen in the MobileMe system preference?). 
I could really use the syncing features, but I don't need a full individual account. My brother has an individual account, and we"|"were thinking of upgrading it to a family, so I could get the syncing features (I have a work mac, and a personal mac). 
The Apple Website is a little vague on this:

A Family Pack subscription includes one Individual account with 20GB of combined email and file storage, plus four Family Member accounts, each with its own email address and 5GB of storage. Convert an Individual account to a Family Pack anytime you like — you just pay the difference.

I'm not sure whether to read it as 'a family pack is a glorified email account' or 'a family pack is a full mobile me account (with syncing features) but less space for each user'.

A: Yes a family pack allows you to create 4 additional usernames that have all the features of the main account, the only difference being that they are limited to 5gb of storage.  I upgraded to a family pack and used one of the 4 additional accounts for my girlfriend so she could use Find My iPhone (before it was free with an AppleID) she can also sync her bookmarks, dock, prefs, etc just like my account.  
The only thing I am not 100% sure is if she can also create alias email addresses like I can on my main account but I believe she can."|"want to share calendars, contacts, and bookmarks.

I don't think I can afford both an iPhone and an iPad, so I was considering switching to a dumbphone (non-smartphone) and an iPad. What features would i lose, or miss, from making this switch - specifically in the iphone-ipad part?

A: It seems to me that you would spend less money overall if you just kept the iPhone and got a wifi-only iPad"|"rather than switching phones and plans (not including that nasty early termination fee on the iPhone contracts). That is what I have now and I really like it.
But, to answer your question specifically, even taking into consideration the iOS 4 release for iPad later this year, you will be missing, at minimum, all of the camera-related functionality of the iPhone, but then there is visual voicemail and easy (and cheap) email. That's a lot to give up all things considered.

A: The internet, and a pretty great camera, in your pocket.

A: In addition to the good answers already given, there's also:


*

*FaceTime

*Video

*Synchronization (you'd have to always manually update your phone contacts)


Also worth mentioning: if you buy a 3G iPad there's no monthly charge unless/until you sign a carrier agreement. IMO, you're always better off buying one with 3G if there's a >0% chance you'll need it someday. Yes, it's more money initially, but it's a one-time charge.

A: Split the question into two separate items and make a decision about them:


*

*(Why) Do you want an iPad? 

*(Why) Do you want to replace your iPhone with a simpler one?


For instance, even if you get an iPad, it would still be convenient to keep the iPhone. Also, if you jailbreak your iPhone, you could broadcast your iPhone's Internet access as a local WIFI hotspot that your iPad could connect to = the cheaper WIFI-only iPad would suffice, rather than getting the 3G version when you're already paying for a 3G data plan for your iPhone."|"Q: What would I lose from switching from iPhone 4+ e-reader to dumbphone+iPad I'm currently using an iPhone 4 and a cheap e-reader that was given to me as a gift.

836||"Q: Revert an account's ""full name"" back to the original I don't think this is a ""short name"" question. I changed my ""full name"" to include my last name, but I'd like to revert back to just my first name. When I try to change the full name entry under ""accounts"" back to ""Richard"" I can't, with the warning ""Name is not available.""
What gives? Is there a way to revert to my original short name? This is strictly cosmetic, right? The only place I see my full name is the right side of the menu bar (my short name has never changed from ""richard""). Thanks!

A: The problem is that your short name is already richard, so your Users’ folder looks like /Users/richard. 
If you want, you could change your short name (provided you’re in Leopard or Snow Leopard) or, not known to a lot of people is that you can create Aliases. 
For example if your name is Robert De Niro Of The Great Canyon (wow!), and your account is robertdeniroofthegreatcanyon, you can create an alias to “robert”, to simplify. 
To do that, in the Advanced Options screen, click the plus (+) button under Aliases and then type your desired account alias. (Do not make any other changes.) click OK and restart (just in case any service may"|"be crazy). 
This is easy and safe, but it doesn’t actually change your short name at all, nor your home folder among other things.
If you want to change your short user name, you have two different approaches. A less “intrusive” method (#1) and a full change (#2):
Option #1: Change your short name, don’t change your home folder’s name.
You basically change your account’s name, but you leave your filesystem alone. Everything will work with your new name, but the files will be under the “old name”’s folder. 
This works fairly well, except that sometimes, programs insist on storing settings based upon your short username, which could lead to some issues with those programs. 
Here’s how to do it:


*

*Disable Automatic Login and FileVault if you have them (for the account you want to rename). You can later reactivate these.

*Logoff completely from the account and login with another account (create one if you have to, you can remove it later).

*ctrl + click on your account name, select advanced options.

*In the “Account Name” field, delete your username and type the new one. Make sure the “home directory” stays the same as it was before, don’t change it.

*Click ok. Restart. Login using your new short name.


Option #2 Change both short name and home folder
Bear in mind that this, like the previous solution, has problems with some settings in certain programs/services that may use your /Users/old_name). You’ll have to check the settings for each and fix it (possibly reconfigure it). After you save the new settings for the programs, things should work ok.
Warning: Time machine will go coo coo if you change your home folder and will have to backup every file again, because it tracks files using their paths. 


*

*Disable Automatic Login and FileVault if you have them (for the account you want to rename). You can later reactivate these.

*Logoff completely from the account and login with another account (create one if you have to, you can remove it later).

*ctrl + click on your account name, select advanced options.

*Like with option #1, change the name of your Account Name.

*Change the Home Directory from /Users/old to /Users/new, where new is the short username you typed in step # 4. 

*Click OK and close all this, open a Terminal (/Application/Utilities/Terminal.app)

*Type the following command, all on one line, and then press Return; when prompted, provide the password of the admin account you’re currently using, and then press Return again:
sudo mv /Users/old /Users/new
(these are the names from step 4 and 5).


*restart!


Why all this trouble and where is the answer to your question?
So after all this, if you want to have robert in your “login menu” I believe you should simply tell it to show the short name and leave the rest of the settings alone:

In any case, if you REALLY want to have both “richard”, you’ll probably have to rename your shortname first.

A: I may be missing something, but I believe I have the direct answer that you are looking for.  I, too changed my ""Full name"" only to find that I could not change it back.
Here's how to fix it in one simple step: 
System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Options -> Network Account Server: Join -> Open Directory Utility ->
Select 'Directory Editor' and at the top left, select 'Users' next to Viewing, click the lock allow write access.
Scroll down to your user name (richard) in the left pane, then select the row in the right pane named 'RealName'.  Finally, change the value of RealName in the bottom right pane:

If there is not an ""official"" way to do this, does somebody know a trick to do so?

A: One solution I found is to use Disk Utility to create a new APFS Volume on my main disk, and then I moved all the files I want to back up on this volume (the size of the volume automatically adapts to it's content). 
Then on Time Machine I excluded all my hard drives except my newly created APFS Volume, in that way it's the only one that gets backed up by Time Machine, and I don't need to update the list unless I add new volumes or hard drives.
And if you don't like to have to navigate to this volume to browse your files, you can always create symlinks to them

A: Select All the files and folders in the disc that contains the folder you want to back up.
Drop them all on the Exclusions"|"window
Remove the folder you want backed up from the exclusions

A: tmutil enables you to edit the exclusion list from the command line.
Because blacklisting folders one by one can be tedious, I wrote deus_ex_tmachina bash script that basically iterate over the folders at the root of your disk and exclude them ; stopping in the middle of the process so you can edit the list.

A: You may exclude items from a Time Machine backup as follows:


*

*Open System Preferences.

*Click Time Machine.

*After having enabled Time Machine and chosen a backup disk, click Options.

*Click + to specify an item that is not to be backed up. The backup disk is included on this list automatically so that it does not back up itself.


A: Easily - no. Time Machine's selection only uses exclusion so you'd have to exclude everything but the folders you want. I'd recommend looking at a different solution instead (eg. rsync, Retrospect, or other backup software)

A: I'm not sure if time machine follows symbolic links, but if so, you could have a high level directory full of links to the directories you want backed-up, then exclude all the top level directories except that one....slightly roundabout, but not too work intensive (if time machine backs up the content of symbolic links, which I slightly doubt, but should be checked....)

I checked. It does not work. Other ideas?

A: In my case I have items on an external drive that I want to have backed-up. What I do is create a partition on that drive and then remove that partition from the exclusion list. 

A: I answered this elsewhere as well, sorry for the redundancy but this question is asked multiples times on this site alone.  Time Machine (And excluding files) is not a good solution.  
Short answer... ""Get Backup 3"" from the Mac Apps Store.
I'm looking for the same solution, (Or was).  Basically I want to back up just one folder multiple times a day to a flash drive, similar to the way Time Machine does.  BETTER YET! (Million $ idea here...) I would like a local cloud, i.e. I make a change, it updates my local backup on my flash drive to be in sync right then and there when I make the change (Like drop box does).  The closest thing I have found is ""Get Backup 3"" on the Mac App store.  You can choose an Origin folder and a destination folder and set it to synchronize the two.  You can choose the direction as well which is great, : Folder A to Folder B, or Folder B to Folder A, or even Bi-Directional updates.  You can also schedule sync times.  I set mine up for close to the end of the day.  It backs up and I leave my thumb drive at work in case my laptop ever gets stolen at least I have a copy of my files backed up (Network here is very restrictive and painfully slow).
Hope that helps."|"Q: Can I select only a few specific folders to back up with Time Machine? Can I backup only specific folders with Time Machine? 
If there is not an ""official"" way to do this, does somebody know a trick to do so?

A: I found a solution that works for me. I created a new APFS volume on my main disk, and then moved all the files I want to back up on this volume (the size of the volume automatically adapts to it's content). 
Then on Time Machine I excluded all my hard drives except my newly created APFS Volume, in that way it's the only one that gets backed up by Time Machine, and I don't need to update the list unless I add new volumes or hard drives.
And if you don't like to have to navigate to this volume to browse your files, you can always create symlinks to them"|0.365386426448822|0.14970059880239522

844||"Q: Use the power of the graphic card on a MacBook? Is there a way to use the processor of the graphic card on a new MacBook Pro to do some long and repetitive calculations?

A: Have you looked at CUDA (nVidia only) or OpenCL to do just this? Both technologies are made to leverage the"|"GPU.

A: Running computationally expensive tasks on the GPU is something that is coded on the development side.  This is not something an end user can do directly.  If this is something you intend to do from the development side, it should probably be posted on Stack Overflow.
Wikipedia: GPGPU

A: There are a number of programs written to use the GPU to help users run through various calculations more quickly than with their processor.
There is an OpenCL directory here of math programs claiming to use the GPU:
http://opencl.name/top/Science/Math/Software/
You'll have to sort through which ones run on OS X.
There are OpenCL tutorials on the net, though, and Xcode is inexpensive.  If you understand rudimentary programming principles you should be able to modify the examples/tutorials to do what you want.  When you get stuck, Stack Overflow is there to help."|"graphic processor unit (GPU) for general-purpose computation. 

A: You can use the built-in scripting language of the GPU (called CUDA) to write code that runs on the GPU.
Here is an example of how to use CUDA to calculate the Fibonacci sequence on a GPU:

#include <cuda.h>
#include <math.h>

__global__ void fibonacci(int *f, int n) {
 int idx = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;
 if (idx < n) {
 f[idx] = (idx == 0) ? 0 : f[idx - 1] + f[idx];
 }
}

int main() {
 int n = 10;
 int *f = new int[n];
 fibonacci<<<1, n>>>(f, n);
 for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
 printf(""%d\n"", f[i]);
 }
 delete[] f;
 return 0;
}

This code uses the CUDA API to declare a function called fibonacci that calculates the Fibonacci sequence on a GPU. The fibonacci function is written in a special way that allows it to be compiled to run on the GPU. The main function uses the CUDA API to allocate memory for the Fibonacci sequence and to launch the fibonacci function to calculate the sequence. The main function then prints out the results.

Note that you need to have a GPU with CUDA support and a compatible CUDA-capable driver to run this code.

A: Try running the Apple Hardware Test.  If I remember right, reboot holding D.  If that doesn't work, reboot while holding D, with an OS X disk in.  Of course you'll need to have an external DVD drive for that to work.

A: It would depend first on what it means to not read the discs. Does the disc insert and then eject, or simply not show up in the Finder? Does it mount and not burn properly? etc.

Is that possible? I can't find anything like this in iTunes and can't find any 3rd party application or service that can do this.

A: I don’t know of a software that can do that automatically, however you have two choices:
1) If you want the podcast to be downloaded and ready, you will have to remote control your home PC and do it normally as if you were sitting in front of your computer. (Either through VNC or Windows Remote Connection)
2) If you don’t mind doing it when you get to your home, you can use a service like Dropbox and have a text file with the URLs. Since Dropbox will sync automatically, you can open the file when you get home and the urls will be there. Or use a service like Instapaper to save the URLs that will be ready when you get home to be added to your home iTunes.

A: The memory and the hard drive are probably the easiest to remove and reuse. But there are plenty of parts that could be re-used including the keyboard, the display, optical drive and airport.
The site ifixit has a great guide to disassembling MacBook Pro machines.
If you do not have a need for the parts yourself, you may be able to sell them on eBay or elsewhere.

Replace the display with the screen from your MacBook, and you can flip it for 3-8 times that, depending on the specific specs and condition of the machine.
Beyond that, the Hard Drive should be easily removable and reusable in a variety of other environments. Most other parts will not be broadly useful outside of other MBP's.

A: There is a new editor on the block called Chocolat. I've been using it for a week now and really like it. It has a lot of the features of TextMate (as well as supporting TextMate bundles) but I've found it to work a lot better with large sets of files especially over the network.

A: I'm partial to Coda these days, but came across this the other day when I was looking for something else.  I haven't tried it, so not sure if it meets all your needs. It's free, but only because it's not being developed anymore. 
http://www.web-scripter.com/

A: There's a new text editor called Kod that is modern, fast, and support projects. 
A warning -- development on Kod is just starting, so things are a bit unstable. It's alpha-level software at version 0.0.3, although I think it will eventually turn into just the application you're looking for.
Features:


*

*Written from the ground up for 10.6 using Grand Central Dispatch and other new things

*Uses GNU Syntax Highlighting format so there's highlighting support for every language

*Modern UI with Chromium tabs

*Scriptable using node.js


A: Atom by GitHub is a free and powerful text editor and IDE build with programmers in mind. At the same time, it also doesn't give the impression of being a heavy-weight IDE.

All are very fast on SSD modern Mac, even the MacBook (One) with a mobile CPU with minimum cores and clock rate. All are free, actively developed, extensible, support code control and completion and are extensible, scriptable and can be added to for many languages and syntax. 

A: There is also Brackets, to consider. Written in Javascript, currently developed by Adobe as a ""community guided, open source project"", focuses on web development but can also be used as a generic text editor, has a solid API to extend it and a growing number of extension already available.

A: I would say that MacVim but it's of course a more complicated tool based on the traditional unix vim text-editor with a steep learning curve.
By the way, which aspect of TextMate didn't appeal you?

A: Sublime Text 2
Support for TextMate snippets, languages and color schemes.
Split view, tabbing, projects, commands. Full-screen on Lion and a ""focused"" mode.
Extensible, too.
Very fast, great multiple selection mode and cross-platform.
Currently priced at $59, but a free version is available with occasional alerts.
It also has a rapidly-growing plugin API and surrounding community.

Check it out, it's freaking awesome.
Update: Sublime Text 2 is now superseded by Sublime Text 3 which features various enhancement and performance improvements.

A: I think that Aquamacs might do the trick!

UNIX philosophy is to do one thing and do it well. Integrated support for an SCM is not something easily found. Perhaps you should use an external tool?

  
*
  
*which supports a fast autocompletion
  

As far as I know, only a few major IDE's support this. 
You're not going to find what you're looking for free. Any IDE will feel slow as mud compared to a text editor like TM or TW. 
If you want my honest opinion, try TextMate. Bundles will allow you to replicate some of the behavior you're looking for, the rest you can hope is in 2.0. 

A: Check out Fraise, the successor to Smultron.  It meets many of your requirements.  Here are the ones that are not met:

*

*where the developers are active: Fraise looks like it's now dying like its predecessor

*which includes a basic support for Git and/or SVN: not sure what you mean by this, but Fraise has command line integration

*which supports a fast autocompletion: not positive but I don't think it has autocompletion... but it has commands and text snippets

A: Unless your account is a network account from a server such as OSX Server using directory services (or AD on Windows or LDAP on *nix), then it gets stored in the plist file that stores the local directory services data on your Mac.
Before Lion, these files were simply text formatted xml files stored as shortname.plist in the directory"|"/private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/users
The image is encoded as a JPEG file under the key:
    <key>jpegphoto</key>
    <array>

            AAABAAAAGgAAAAAAAqACAAQAAAABAAACAKADAAQAAAABAAACAAAAAAD/2wBD

If you selected a stock picture instead of a custom one, you may be able to locate that file with the following command:
    dscl . -read /Users/shortname Picture

The system also caches more than a handful of previous pictures so you can usually go back to a favorite picture using the system preference graphical tools. If your plist is stored in binary format, you may use a command like this to dump a xml version of the binary file to /tmp:
    plutil -convert xml1 shortname.plist -o /tmp/shortname.plist


A: The photo can be found in the /Library/Caches folder, if you haven't cleared this folder yet.
Otherwise, I recommend typing:
dscl . -read /Users/short_username JPEGPhoto | tail -1 | xxd -r -p > 
/PATH/TO/accountImage.jpg
on one line in a Terminal window, from Chealion's brilliant answer here. In the above example, a JPEG copy will be saved to /PATH/TO/accountImage.jpg.

A: take a look in ~/Library/Images/iChat Recent Pictures

A: open finder, click: command,shift,G

However, since Lion, the plist files have been converted to binary plist format, and the shortname.plist files have been renamed to com.apple.login.plist.

A: There is also a complete alternative in the form of tcpdump, which comes by default on many OS X installs. The syntax is different, but it's command-line only, and is invaluable in a smaller/command line only environment.

A: As @VxJasonxV said you can use TCPDump and if you don't want the output show on terminal can use >> filename to TCPDump save result on your desired file.
you can use TCPDump with many options but I think this was the best one:
tcpdump -n -v -S -i en1 tcp

en1: interface that you assign IPv4
-v: produce (slightly more) verbose output 
-S: Print absolute, rather than relative, TCP sequence numbers.
-n: Don't convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names.
-i: Listen on interface.

A: First thing to check is : Do your modem support Mac OS X  ?
If the documentation said so, you should try to connect the modem directly on your Mac and see  what happens.
In case nothing works, I'd say that this modem is for PC only and you'll not find any driver for Mac OS X. 
The only way to make it works is to boot on your BootCamp partition and install the driver on it, but you'll can use only Windows and not Mac OS X.

A: From Daring Fireball:

Panic on the Mac App Store
Cabel Sasser on what it’s like for existing
  Mac apps that are now in the App
  Store:

PS:  If you’re a current customer,
    there’s no way to convert a previous
    purchase into a Mac App Store purchase
    — that requires a re-buy. But
    remember, what you have now will"|"continue to work just fine.
UPDATE: The Mac App Store may show
    software bought from us previously as
    “Installed”, even though they’re two
    different licenses. You will not get
    Mac App Store auto-updates unless you
    purchase from the Mac App Store. To
    re-enable the “Purchase” button in the
    Mac App Store, just drag the app to
    the trash. Your preferences/sites will
    not be affected.

In other words, for apps that use the
  same bundle ID for the both the Mac
  App Store and non-App Store versions,
  the Mac App Store will not install
  updates to already-installed non-App
  Store versions, but it will recognize
  them as being already installed. If
  you want to get updates via the Mac
  App Store, you’ll have to re-buy the
  app through the App Store.


A: It depends.
As reported in the Daring Fireball link: it doesn't work for some apps like Panic's Transmit, Unison or Coda. The licensing schemes used when you buy via the App Store versus directly from the developer are different and won't allow for it.
But this article from Cult of Mac has the author successfully updating a previously installed version of TextWrangler to the latest version via the App Store.

I just tried a quick Mac App Store experiment.
One of the more tempting offerings on offer there is TextWrangler, the excellent all-purpose text editor from Bare Bones software. It’s been free on the web for years, and now it’s free on the store.
I already had a copy installed, but on closer inspection, my existing version was 3.1, and the one in the App Store was 3.5. What would happen, I wondered, if I clicked the “Install” button? Would the App Store version be installed separately? Would there be some kind of conflict? Or would it Just Work?
Of course, it Just Worked. TextWrangler 3.5 was installed where I expected it to be, and the older version was overwritten.
So now you know: if you see something in the store that’s already on your hard disk, you shouldn’t have any problems installing a newer version from there. 

I disagree with the Cult of Mac articles conclusion, that ""if you see something in the store that’s already on your hard disk, you shouldn’t have any problems installing a newer version from there"" -- as Panic has directly contradicted that conclusion and they build and sell through the App Store so, pretty authoritative there.
I did talk to the developer of my favourite Twitter app, Kiwi, and he said he wasn't sure if the App Store could be used to update copies of Kiwi bought before the App Store came in to existence.

Possible Duplicate:
What are the benefits of iPhone jailbreak? 

What is jail breaking? Why do people do it? What is the advantage and disadvantage?

A: IOS_jailbreaking

Jailbreaking is a process that allows iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch users to install homebrew applications on their devices by unlocking the operating system and allowing the user root access."|"Once jailbroken, iPhone users are able to download many extensions and themes previously unavailable through the App Store via unofficial installers such as Cydia, Rock Your Phone and Icy Installer. A jailbroken iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch is still able to use the App Store and iTunes.

It is mostly done to escape the restrictive nature of the App Store. Once you have jailbroken an iPhone you are free to install a lot of software that apple would not normally allow. Such as modifying the lock screen to display useful information, or enabling multitasking on an iPhone 3G.

A: Jailbreaking is to break out of the ""jail"" that Apple runs normal software in so you can do unauthorised modifications such as install your own applications or alter system components. Jailbreaking is often done by exploiting security issues in iOS and such are closed with the next software update.
If you jailbreak your iOS device the device is unsupported. While it's not illegal Apple has explicitly stated it's entirely your problem for any issues you cause. (The Genius bars won't touch a jailbroken phone unless it's been restored and the problems exists on a non hacked version of iOS)."|"Jailbreaking is the process of modifying the operating system of an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch in order to run apps that are otherwise restricted by Apple. The goal of jailbreaking is to give users more flexibility and control over the devices they own. Some of the reasons people jailbreak their devices include: 
 
 
1. Unlocking the device: Jailbreaking allows users to unlock their devices, which can then be used on any GSM network. This is particularly useful for international travelers who don't want to be locked into a single carrier. 
2. Installing third-party apps: Apple restricts which apps can be installed on its devices, but jailbreaking allows users to download and install apps that are otherwise unavailable. This can give users more flexibility and choice in the apps they use. 
3. Customizing the user experience: Jailbreaking allows users to customize their device's user experience by installing custom themes, tweaking system settings, and more. This can give users a more personalized and unique experience on their devices. 
 
 
While jailbreaking has many benefits, it also has some potential risks and drawbacks. Some of the disadvantages of jailbreaking include: 
 
 
1. Potential for bugs and security risks: Since jailbreaking modifies the operating system, it can introduce potential bugs and security risks. Apple is constantly patching and updating its operating system to fix vulnerabilities, but jailbreaking can create new vulnerabilities that users will have to be aware of and take steps to protect against. 
2. Loss of warranty: Apple's warranty policy typically covers devices that have been modified or tampered with, which means that jailbreaking could potentially void the warranty. This means that if the device has any problems that are covered under the warranty, users will have to pay to have it fixed or replaced. 
3. Risk of bricking: Jailbreaking can sometimes cause the device to become ""bricked,"" meaning that it will no longer function properly. This is more likely to happen if users install unofficial software or make other modifications to the device. 
 
 
Overall, the pros and cons of jailbreaking depend on the individual user and their specific needs and goals. It's important to weigh the potential benefits and risks before deciding whether or not to jailbreak your device."|0.48303312063217163|0.12914485165794065

In addition to the battery, you can add info to your menu bar such as disk usage, network, internal temp. sensors, and more with graphs and detals. 
For the battery part, upon clicking on the battery percentage instead of a useless menu you will be presented with information such as battery health, charge cycles, amperage, and cell charges and more, so for only $10 it's a worthwhile investment. 
One of my favorite features is the date/time thing which actually shows you a drop down calendar and world clocks. Overall, iStat Menus is definitely worth the $10 lifetime investment.

Being jailbroken, I already have multitasking and home-screen wallpapers. What does the new iOS give me that I don't already have access to?

A: I've done it and it's not worth the trouble.  I'm considering rolling back to 3.1.2.
The beneficial changes are minimal (and most can be provided by a"|"jailbreak app), and the performance decrease is very noticeable.  I've found that crashes are much more frequent as well.
My advice: Don't do it.

A: In my personal experience, iOS 4 was only marginally slower than iPhone OS 3, so it really comes down to features.
First, iOS 4 does not allow you to put home screen wallpapers on an iPhone 3G. I don't have experience with multitasking on a jailbroken device, but again iOS does not provide this functionality on the iPhone 3G. However, given the memory and processor of the iPhone 3G, you really wouldn't want to multitask on the device.
In terms of features that iOS 4 does offer the iPhone 3G, here are some top ones:


*

*Mail - unified inbox, multiple Exchange accounts, message threading

*Folders - a very useful way to store similar apps to save space

*iBooks - eBook and PDF reader (useful, though this app was somewhat slow on my 3G)


It's also worth noting that there are already apps that require iOS 4 and the number's only going to grow. Not having iOS 4 will reduce the number of apps that will run on your device.
Since I never really got a lot of utility from jailbreaking, it made the decision to upgrade pretty easy for me. However, if having a wallpaper or running apps from Cydia is important to you, you're not really missing out on a whole lot, at least for now.

A: Most of what I've heard is that it's not worth running on the 3G as it's very sluggish."|"jailbreak tweak), and the downsides are:

- battery life is worse (I'm noticing 10-15% less battery life)
- it's much more buggy (e.g. keyboard doesn't work properly)
- it's slower (e.g. scrolling is choppy)
- it's more bloated (e.g. adds 100+ apps I don't need)
- it's more restrictive (e.g. doesn't allow installing apps outside the app store)
- it's more expensive (e.g. Apple charges $10 to unlock the phone)
- it's less flexible (e.g. can't run apps that require root)
- it's less future-proof (e.g. Apple will stop supporting it soon)

So I'd recommend staying on 3.1.2. If you want to learn more about iOS4, you can read about the new features on Apple's website."|0.4045453667640686|0.1546134663341646

A: No it is not possible for full development and submission unless you want to run OS X in a VM on your PC.
You can develop, to an extent, on other platforms, but as far as I know you need a Mac to submit.

A: Nope, you have to use a Mac. All the tools are on the Mac, as is the simulator program you'll need to test in.
Even if you could somehow finagle the whole thing running in Windows you still need a Mac to submit to Apple to get it on the App Store.
Cheapest scenario you're looking $699 for a Mac Mini and $99 for the iOS Developer Program (which you won't need until you want to run the thing on a real phone). You can go cheaper on the hardware if you buy it used but something to keep in mind is that it must be an Intel-based Mac running Leopard (10.5) or higher.

A: Depending on what you want to do, you can develop web apps that look pretty much the same as an actual application, start from the home screen and even hide the navigation and URL bars. Take a look at Glyphboard, for an example.
Native apps require Mac OS X, as far as I know.

A: Yes, you can. Check out this website called macincloud.com. Most people are trying to install Mac OS to PC hardware, sometimes it works, the drawback for that is newer mac updates often break the installation. macincloud.com actually allows you to rent a mac and access the Mac remotely. Therefore you always have the latest Mac OS and it is a good way to start developing iphone apps right away since you are actually using a native Mac system.

Now, this is not that"|"hard, and you should think it's quite easy.
if you never worked on a Mac before, you should invest some minutes to see some basic stuff, how it used to work on Windows and how it does now on Mac, for example, take some nice video tutorials from Apple website

Regarding UPGRADING your Mac Mini, you should check what model you have and have a look on MacSales Videos on how to replace the hardware
you will find all models in the Mac Sales Tech Support page

About what hardware you should fit into your new Mac Mini, using Mac Sales you can order the memory, harddrive (or SSD) and any Optical drive as well, if you outside US, (though I'm in Denmark, I buy stuff from them time to time) you grab the model number of what you wanted, and ""fly"" to a near store and buy it :)

Warning
You are trying to buy 8Gb of Ram, and your mac only support up to 4Gb, in witch 3Gb is addressable.
Please read the specifications of your model before you buy anything!


A: For discs I would not install inside but add a firewire external disk (your mini has FW 400). It might even run faster than the internal.
For memory I would get third party but see video tutorials on how to do it

A: I've searched far and wide for a way to do the same thing. The best I can come up with is an app called AccessMenuBarApps. 

A: I don't know any way to do this, so I usually switch to finder.
Note that some extras can be dragged on the menubar while holding down command; this might get some extras that you need in an app with long menu lists accessible from there.

This may not be a working answer (see below), but it's too big and format-laden for a comment. I notice there's a default shortcut of ^ F8 (and in many cases, Fn ^ F8) which let's you ""Move focus to status menus"".

Then you can save the combined movie.
Of course, it is likely you don't already have QuickTime 7 Pro already installed. Apple charge extra for QuickTime Pro (£20) which may not be worthwhile for you if you don't use it much. Also, if you are using Snow Leopard, that includes QuickTime X which doesn't have a Pro version available. In that case you'd need to install QuickTime 7 in addition to QuickTime X.

It’s a small detail that, if you come from Windows (or Linux) turns out to be of great help (provided you really care about improving your typing skills). Available on most Cocoa applications by default (thanks to the underlying technology), it underlines incorrect words and obvious grammar errors. It has its bad days, but the results are usually better than nothing. I type mainly in English and Spanish and in both cases, it’s a decent solution. 
But I just realized that I have a problem with it. I rarely use the mouse when I’m in “Type Mode”. If I’m writing I don’t need to use the mouse. I just don’t use it; I manage to perform most of what I have to with the keyboard and its shortcuts. 
There are notable exceptions to the above (where a dialog requires mouse action, or there’s simply no way to get the focus of a particular UI element). Those exceptions are annoying (and frequent), but I guess I already deal with them (by grabbing the mouse and killing a kitten). 
However, there’s one that I’d like to know how to solve, and maybe the minds behind the site can clear for me. 
Imagine the following simple scenario. TextEdit. 
You start typing this: 

In order to fix the misspelled word, you have a few choices with your mouse, or you could use the ⇧Shift⌘Cmd: combination to bring this:

However that dialog doesn’t have keyboard focus and I am unable to get it, so I have to reach the mouse, click on it, and fix the problem. That’s not good.
What I want is to be able to bring this:

…with my keyboard. 
That menu came when I right clicked on the word. 
How do you deal with this? Do you use the mouse? Do you use the keyboard?
Enlighten me please. 
UPDATE FOR"|"LION OS X 10.7
As many of you are aware, OS X 10.7 ""Lion"" is out and it brings some changes in this area. Sadly, the biggest complain is still not 100% fixed.
The good news is, it is ""possible"" to spell check using the keyboard only, although we still don't have a nice popup like the ""right click"" over an underlined word. 
The Spell Check pane can be focused now by using ⌃F6 if it loses focus, but has it by default when you invoke it with ⇧⌘:, this allows you to invoke it over a red-underlined word and press ⏎ to change the word (or TAB to focus the list of alternatives and then ⏎ to change it)… but not really because…
…the Bad news is, if I make a mistake right here and I try to bring the spell check, it will go to the next mistake, not the word I have below the cursor, which is annoying, because it means you have to actually go back with the cursor before invoking the spell checker. 
Also there are no shortcuts on the Grammar Pane, so you have to TAB around the fields to click anything other than ""Change"". The order of the options is also weird:
1) Upon launching Grammar Pane, focus is on Change for ""return"" but you are ready to start typing a replacement if you want. So you could type the ""right word"" and press return, or you could press return to accept the first replacement on the list, or you could press TAB to move to that list, select a new one (with the arrow keys) and finally press return to accept it.
2) If you wanted to move to the next change without accepting anything for the current word, you need to press TAB four times and then the space bar to click on find next. 
3) Focus is one way, if you reach the last option in that dialog, it won't cycle back to the first option, so you have to shift-tab back in the focus chain. (weird?)
4) You can't focus the Define, Guess or Automatic by Language Buttons/Combo boxes, unless you grab your mouse. 
5) You can dismiss the panel by pressing escape.
Finally, going from ""mistake to mistake"" is achieved with ⌘;; this will jump from red underlined word to the next in a cycle.

A: Yo ! Man, I got the best thing for you.
Just type some of your characters of word & press F5 & see the magic, It is what you want. Suppose your not getting the word rub some & get what you want.
Here is snap-shot of what you want.  ( source of lots of shortcut keys )
Suppose, I am a user, I would do as follows.


*

*Start typing

*suppose I typed Compu

*and then I would press F5 for getting hints


simple & short just F5 does all for you, no need to press Cmd+: and then get correct one from list. It will give you list on the spot.


A: I just went through Apple's Keyboard Shortcuts Document and really didn't fine anything meaningful. I picked some of the more vague ones and tried them out in TextEdit to no avail.
While I don't want this to be the answer, my current idea is to use Mouse Keys, as silly as it is to say. Activating the shortcut via Universal Access.prefpane, then quint (five)-tapping Option ⌥, then you should be able to call up the window by either;


*

*holding (with a numpad) 5 (without a numpad) i, or;

*pressing (with a numpad) 0 (without a numpad) m.


The context window should pop-up, and you can select the correct spelling/action as you desire, and move on... after you disable Mouse Keys with the same shortcut, that is. (Quint (five)-tapping Option ⌥).

A: Open Automator, create a Service without input in any application, and add a single Run AppleScript action. Copy and paste the following code:
tell application ""System Events""
    # locate frontmost application
    repeat with ap in application processes
        if frontmost of ap is true then
            set fmap to ap
        end if
    end repeat

    tell application process fmap
        # click its ""Show/Hide Spelling and Grammar""
        set scw to windows of fmap whose name is ""Spelling and Grammar"" and role description is ""floating window""
        try
            tell first menu bar of fmap
                tell first menu of (first menu bar item whose name is ""Edit"")
                    tell first menu of (first menu item whose name is ""Spelling"")
                        if (count of scw) = 0 then
                            tell (first menu item whose name is ""Show Spelling and Grammar"") to click
                        else
                            tell (first menu item whose name is ""Hide Spelling and Grammar"") to click
                            return
                        end if
                    end tell
                end tell
            end tell
        on error
            display alert ""Cannot open/close Spelling and Grammar window!""
            return
        end try

        # focus the Spelling and Grammar field
        set fw to first window of fmap whose name is ""Spelling and Grammar"" and role description is ""floating window""
        perform (first action of fw whose name is ""AXRaise"")
        set focused of first text field of fw to true
    end tell
end tell

Save as a Service and assign a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences » Keyboard » Keyboard Shortcuts » Services. I set it up so it toggles the window when pressed repeatedly. Is, of course, locale dependent and expects the grammar menu item in the usual location; displays an error if that fails.
Unfortunately, being Automator, it's somewhat slow.

What I determined is that pin 11 on the dock connector is used to enable audio out on the dock connector if pin 11 is grounded. I took a my dock connector apart and pin 11 was not connected. Determining which pin 11 is was difficult as the connector is quite small. After soldering a jumper between pin 11 and ground my 5th and 6th gen iPods can once again be used with the headphone amplifier.

The question is this; Can the cheapest Mac Pro 5,1 single quad-core Nehalem 2.8 GHz be upgraded to the dual six-core Westmere 2.93 GHz at some point in the future?
If not, what would be the cheapest one that could? 

A: Short answer:
The lowest end Mac Pro that can be upgraded to a 2.93 12-core Westmere is the 2.66GHz 12-core Westmere.
Long answer:
The single socket Nehalem and Westmere Mac Pros literally have one socket. Aside from that, most of the lower end configs ship with a 1066MHz memory bus instead of a 1333MHz bus. In order to upgrade to a part that"|"uses faster ram you will need to replace all your ram, and probably solder some resistors to change the clock multipliers on the board.
Without SMD soldering you will need to match the bus speed of the processor, which means if you have a 1066MHz memory interface the highest end part you will be able to install is are quad core 2.66GHz Xeon E5640s. There is also no guarantee the firmware will actually initialize it correctly, though odds are good that it will.

A: Yes you can upgrade the Mac Pro 5,1 single quad Nehalem base configuration to a dual 6-core Westmere. There is no soldering or any thing required with in the Mac Pro. Everything is on the back plane with in the Mac Pro, it is the same between all processor configurations.The  dual socket processor tray is where the changes live, that is what really what makes a Mac Pro what it is in terms of RAM, processor sockets, and QPI speed.

In fact OWC's upgrade services demonstrates the upgrade flexibility of the Mac Pro. Since OWC offers a mail in upgrade service for this version of Mac Pro, where you mail the processor tray to them. They offer single chip upgrades where they swap the CPU and additionally offer dual socket options where they trade processor trays with you for a dual socket version. 
So all you need to do to upgrade to a faster Westmere Mac Pro is the dual socket process tray and the CPUs to go with it. And it looks like the processor trays are available for order from Apple as noted in this AnandTech botched CPU upgrade article for an older Mac Pro 2009 version. However ordering one might be a trail and error processes, since its probably not a common user part to buy.

Thankfully, the folks at the Crabtree Valley Mall Apple Store in Raleigh, NC are AnandTech readers and quickly understood what had happened. They ordered the replacement part and I waited.

When I look inside the sparse-bundle which Time Machine generates then I see that the folder-structure ordered by dates. So theoretically I could copy the files from my old TM sparse-bundle into the new one. Is this possible?

A: I tried: it works.
Here is how:
I have a time machine volume and a backup of it. I update this backup every two months, using Super Duper.
Recently, several successive mistakes made my time machine volume loose its first two years of backups. I then had a primary time machine volume with all backups but first two"|"years and a backup time machine volume with all backups but latest two months.
I decided to experiment. Starting from scratch on a new hard drive, I copied the backup time machine volume to the new hard drive with Super Duper (backup all files using erase and save option). Then I copied the primary time machine volume on top of that, again with Super Duper (backup all files, using copy files that are different).
I ended with a new working time machine volume including all backups, from day one up to today.

A: Simply: Don't!
Time machine uses hardlinks, that you will not be able to recreate by simply copying stuff around. What this means in plain english is you might end up with each copy of the file taking up space - rapidly filling the drive.
Time Machine uses great care to only store each file once - and only takes up more space when the file changes. It assumes everything already stored is correct and won't go back and ""fix"" any errors you make. It's possible to make a tool to merge the backups, but Snow Leopard makes it easy to browse both backups. Just connect all the drives and option click the Time Machine icon in the menu bar to browse the other backup drives and see that history.
Many people have their time machine data on several drives - you can safely put them on the shelf and move to a new drive rather than go back and edit the past. It's easy to move the whole package to a new drive if needed - just not splice data in to an existing backup folder.
A great place for information is this time machine and internals site  and also the Time Machine discussions forum at Apple (I'm assuming we're talking about Snow Leopard here).

A: Time Machine does not (or should not) work when you tamper with it's files in any way. Even a cloning of the TM backup and restoring it can (and probably will) make Time Machine not work with the backups anymore."|"Q: Merge Time Machine Backup Is it possible to merge to Time Machine Backups?

How do I make a clip shorter than 5ms?

A: I don't have an official document anywhere outlining this as a specific limitation, but having used iMovie for a while, and having just tried to replicate what you're trying to do, I'm fairly confident in saying that this isn't supported in iMovie.

893||"Q: How to securely erase an SSD drive? I'm pretty new to SSD technology, so I don't know how it compares to hard drives when it comes to securely erasing the drive. Is it enough to run Disk Utility and erase the drive with the option ""overwrite with zeroes"", or is this designed for hard drives? Are there other actions that should be taken?
I'm not looking for NSA-grade security though, just the kind of wipe you'd do if you're returning or selling the Mac.

A: Open a terminal and type the following command:
df -k

Note the first column corresponding to the partition of the SSD you
would like to irreversibly erase. Let's say it is /dev/disk1s2.
Type the following command:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk1s2 bs=100k

where /dev/rdisk1s2 is the raw device associated with your partition
on SSD. This command will completely write this partition from 1st block
available to the last one. This command will last long (~1/2 h for 100 Gbytes) with no nice scroll bar of progress.
Once this command return you the prompt of your shell the disk has been
completly and irreversibly erased.
Start Disk Utility and check this partition.
It will tell you it is dammaged beyond any form of repair.
And it is right.
Just format this partition as you like.
Here is what is happening at the physical blocks level:

A: The ""Security Options..."" button in Disk Utility is currently grayed out for SSDs. According to http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3680, erasing an SSD normally might be secure enough:

Note: With OS X Lion and an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD."|"For more security, consider turning on FileVault 2 encryption when you start using the SSD drive.

It is still possible to run something like diskutil secureErase freespace 4 disk0s2 from Terminal on the recovery partition.
Simply turning on FileVault 2 before erasing the drive is probably a better option though. According to this answer, performing a remote wipe also just erases the encryption key if FileVault 2 is enabled:

Yes, when you remotely wipe the computer it does a secure wipe. Apple even warns you that it could take as long as a day. However, if your drive was encrypted with FileVault 2, then it is not necessary to erase the disk. It is sufficient to securely erase the encryption key(s) stored on the disk, so that's what they do. It's very quick and as secure as the underlying encryption system is, which for now is very secure.

http://training.apple.com/pdf/wp_osx_security.pdf:

FileVault 2 provides IT departments with the ability to erase the encryption key from a given Mac at any time to ensure that encrypted data cannot be accessed by either user login or data recovery tools. This process is referred to as a remote wipe.


A: It depends on your paranoia level. Because of the way SSDs handle writing data, doing a zero-once on an SSD is not as good as doing so on a hard drive.
When you write a particular data page on an HD, the new data is simply written over the old data, replacing it. Write zeros over the whole disk and all the old data will be gone. SSDs, on the other hand, cannot simply overwrite individual pages. In order to replace the data on a page, the old data must first be erased, and SSDs cannot erase individual pages; they have to erase entire blocks consisting of many pages. 
So what happens when you ask an SSD to overwrite, say, page #5, is that the SSD leaves the data on page #5 alone, but marks it as invalid, allocates another currently-blank page (say, #2305), writes the new data to page #2305, and makes a note that next time the OS asks for page #5 it should get #2305 instead. The original page #5 data sits there until some later time, when the drive needs more space, moves any remaining valid pages away from the block, and erases it. SSDs have more physical memory capacity than they expose to the computer, so they can juggle blocks like this for a while before actually having to erase anything (and when they do actually erase something, there's no good way to predict which blocks of leftover data will be chosen for erasure). See this AnandTech review for way more details (warning: it's fairly long, and the relevant stuff is spread around).
Net result: if you write zeros over the ""whole"" drive, you haven't actually overwritten all the old data. You have updated the controller's translation table so it'll never return any of the old data to the OS (those pages are all invalid). But if someone's hardcore enough to bypass the controller, they could get some of your data back.
Overwriting twice will probably work, but it depends on the controller's allocation strategy. Overwriting twice with random data (diskutil randomDisk 2 /dev/diskN) is a little more likely to work, but still not guaranteed.  Both of these also have some bad side-effects: they uses some of the lifetime of the drive, and also increase the logical fragmentation on the SSD, decreasing its write performance.
Note that recent versions of OS X's graphical Disk Utility disable the secure erasure options on SSDs (for the reasons discussed above), but the command-line version still allows them. BTW, I have also seen several recommendations to securely erase SSDs by converting them to encrypted format, but this is (if anything) slightly less secure than overwriting with random data.
The best way to secure-erase an SSD is to invoke the controller's built-in secure-erase feature. This should (if the controller designers did their jobs) truly erase all blocks, and also have the side-effect of resetting the logical page map, essentially defragmenting it and restoring its original performance.  Unfortunately, most of the utilities I've seen for doing this (e.g. CMRR's HDDErase) run under DOS, which won't boot on a Mac. I did find a posting on macrumors with (rather complex) instructions for doing a secure erase from a GParted boot CD. It might also be possible to use Parted Magic from a bootable flash drive, but I have not tried this.
Researchers at the Non-Volatile Systems Lab at UCSD have tested various ways of sanitizing SSDs by ""erasing"" the drive, then disassembling it to bypass the controller, and checking for remnant data (summary, full paper).  Their results mostly agree with what I said above (and also show that the built-in secure-erase command isn't always implemented properly):

Our results lead to three conclusions:
  First, built-in commands are effective, but manufacturers
  sometimes implement them incorrectly. Second,
  overwriting the entire visible address space of an SSD
  twice is usually, but not always, sufficient to sanitize the
  drive. Third, none of the existing hard drive-oriented
  techniques for individual file sanitization are effective on
  SSDs."|"Q: How to securely erase an SSD drive? I'm pretty new to SSD technology, so I don't know how it compares to hard drives when it comes to securely erasing the drive.

A: I'm not sure if this will help you, but I can tell you how to wipe an SSD using the command line.

I found that if I just switch the lock switch to unlocked and back to lock while leaving the iPod connected to the stereo, this ""wakes"" the iPod up and allows it to then go to sleep shortly thereafter without disrupting the ""pause"". I should note that I do not have any issues with the iPod going to sleep when it is not connected to the Alpine.
After playing with it some more, I discovered how to get it to sleep without touching the iPod. If I just turn the car off after running the engine, the iPod does as described above (paused but not sleeping). However, if I then turn the car back on to accessory (without starting the engine) and wait a couple of seconds for the stereo to begin to initialize (the 'Alpine' name appears on the display) and then turn the car off the iPod will go to sleep. There is something about just turning the engine off that leaves the iPod in an unsleepable pause.

901||"Q: Is it generally advisable to get anti-virus software for Mac OS X? Is it worth to buy an anti-virus software for Mac OS X?
I heard both opinions like ""it's not possible to get a virus on Mac OS X"" and ""Mac OS X is also vulnerable against virus... ""
Which is true? What is the accepted practice, if any? Under what circumstances would anti-virus be advisable?

A: The simple fact is that malware has always existed for Mac OS (OS X and macOS), so the statement that a Mac can't get malware is patently, demonstrably and dangerously false.
A second fact is that Apple has done a good job with technology to make the macOS ecosystem largely immune to most threats. This ""immune system"" consists of sandboxed application design, entitlements to let developers express intent when they need out of the sandbox, signed code to prevent modifications that turn a known app malicious, App Store distribution, system integrity protection, XProtect file quarantine mechanism with a free online update service.
Historically and for many years; the scarcity of viruses, trojans and other malware that spread widely or affect a broad cross-section of Mac users has contributed to a perceived complacency about good security hygiene. The good news, is macs have a built in multi-layered defense system against virus and trojan/malevolent software. This means that most of the recent exploits rely on people unintentionally sabotaging themselves by self-defeating built in defenses. With a small investment of time, you can significantly decrease the need for additional anti-virus protection on OS X.
The calculus of whether running a specific antivirus package is a moving target (vendors typically react to bugs and threats - so what was true yesterday may not be true tomorrow). This makes general answers about the merits of software easily out-dated in a month's time (let alone the two and a half years that have passed since this question was first asked).
What hasn't changed for decades, is that each user should at least spend some time thinking about what is on their device and how painful total compromise might be to them. Based on how valuable your time is to you, it would be silly for someone that has paid IT staff to advise them to not spend $1,000 extra dollars on evaluating security to include potentially installing anti-virus software. It would also be silly for a casual home user to pay for software rather than invest some time to mitigate known risks in their behavior in response to a healthy fear of the unknown.
There are many cases where additional anti-virus protection is critically important. There are also many cases where it is totally un-needed. I would recommend anyone browse these few Apple knowledge base articles to gauge their ""baseline security aptitude"" and then reach out and learn more before spending any money on anti-virus software1.


*

*Use gatekeeper, automatic updates to apps and system files and malicious lists for quarantine.

*Protect your computer from harmful applications - the very basics

*Safety tips for handling email attachments and content downloaded from the Internet - a good primer on attachments and executable code 

*Apple ID: Tips for protecting the security of your account - great tips on account hygiene, applicable for all online accounts

*Safari: Using encryption and secure connections - starts with"|"the basics, but gets technical quickly. Perhaps better is about certificates to get started.


My only critique of the above articles would be the admonishment to frequently change passwords. This is of limited value when you start making unique passwords and don't as a matter of course enter those passwords on other computers. Changing passwords is of little use when your using them on compromised computers, since the new password is stolen as easily as the old one was.
Once you've mastered the basics, you should have absorbed the following ideas:


*

*how to use the OS X keychain for storing passwords

*considered or implemented having a few distinct passwords

*and have started securing your account passwords as well as your computer (by applying the tips on Securing Apple ID to other accounts)


After the basics, now it's time to think about increasing your overall security by spending money on anti-virus or a good unique password generation toolset2 to automate secure storage of stronger, unique passwords. 
Without being proficient at the level of involvement in the linked articles above, spending money and potentially adding instability or slowness from anti-virus software might not make sense for many users. Furthermore, Apple is clearly intent on getting ahead of this problem with the one-two punch of the App Store model where spreading unsafe software installation practices is clearly working with GateKeeper to allow most people to have automated warnings when code is not signed to prevent tampering and assist in tracing the source of malware.
For most Mac users on Lion, the correct answer is to keep running anti-virus if you have it but not to run out and get it unless you have a good reason to spend time and money after getting up to speed on the basics of security.
Since Lion, Apple has hardened the OS faster than bad actors have been able to exploit the OS so for most people and most businesses, not needing additional software as your default option is a sane and probably correct choice.

1 especially with the likes of Mac Defender preying on people looking for legitimate anti-virus software
2 like 1Password

A: There is anti-virus software available for Mac OS X:


*

*Intego VirusBarrier

*ClamXAV (Free)

*Norton AnitVirus Mac Edition

*McAfee VirusScan for Mac

*Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac (Consumer Version is free)


Is it worth it? That's largely up to you. Personally I'd say unless required there's no reason to so long as you practice ""safe computing"" (eg. not opening files from just anywhere, being aware of what is installed on your computer, etc.). However there are some companies that require any computer (regardless of OS) to have up to date anti-virus software installed and operational.
There are no viruses available for Mac OS X but there are several pieces of malware and trojan horses that a user must manually download and install. The anti-virus products (and actually a feature in Mac OS X Snow Leopard) will help fight against these threats but the primary defence is actually user education as the attack vector is primarily social engineering and not using any security hole.

A: There is a nice article on Mac.Appstrom from yesterday about antivirus on Mac OS X (which ones and do we need them).

A: Another possible reason install an antivirus software on a mac could be the protection of systems running other operation systems in a heterogenous network. A virus or malware could reside on a mac drive for several time, until it is activated by an other system, on which it can run.
Therefore it may make sense to install anti-virus software on all computers in a network, to keep the whole network clean.

A: Arriving lately after the legitimate rising of this question I'd like to add here a return on many years and many OSes regular attacks.


*

*There is no Tchernobyl frontier (in 1986, French government
announced publicly that the Tchernobyl radioactiv cloud wouldn't
cross the country frontiers. Since this official public lie, I name
with this metaphor any form of false official security barrier)
to protect MacOS X: we live under the same probability
(all
operating systems are born equal with approximately the same coding
errors ratio:
they are written by us humans who are error prone).

*There are many attacks targeting specifically Symantec AntiVirus
for 2 reasons (I'm refering here to the huge number of external
attacks I see on our external firewall targeting 2967/tcp and
38293/udp =
ports used by Symantec anti-virus.):


*

*(too many security defaults) × (too many people using it) = good target for cybercriminals

*many versions of Symantec AntiVirus failed to install or run
on a case sensitive filesystem which is the sign of a weak
quality control.
To say it bluntly, a vulnerable anti-virus (Symantec) installed on a
robust operating system (MacOS X), may render this last one
vulnerable.

*Many attacks are targeting directly us (the human seated
behind the keyboard), either through booby trapped
web servers or HTML formatted E-mail hidding URL toward
these booby trapped web servers
The 2 best anti-viruses I'm using on many versions of MacOS X are:


*

*clamav

*ClamXav
As their name lets guess it, they are based on the same engine.
It is pretty good quality software, updated very quickly, and running also on many other Unixes. On some new crapware detected clamav included them within less than 72 h where commercial products took a quiet week (just enough time stop to get many thousand computers infested).
I also appreciate Sophos, because it is running on different OSes, does install and run on a case sensitive filesystem (which is the sign of a serious quality control).

A: Probably goes without saying, but if you run any version of Windows in a VM within OS X, those installs of Windows will need antivirus software on them. A surprising number of people I've worked with (including, on one occasion, a head of IT) haven't thought of that.

A: No, it's not worth it to buy any antivirus software for your Mac. This is for two reasons. Firstly, the number of viruses in the wold for OS X is infinitesimal. Your risk is extremely low, and what viruses do exist, are mostly proofs of concept or MS Office Macro Viruses targeting old versions of Office.
The second reason is because for what antivirus needs you do have, ClamXAV is lightweight, effective, and free. So no, it's not worth purchasing. But it is absolutely worth using, and if you can spare a few bucks for the tip jar, I'd encourage you to do that as well.

A: Apple is excellent and keeping up with patching the few Mac vulnerabilities that do arise, so anti-virus isn't necessary as long as your not foolish enough to fall for blatant trojans.
HOWEVER if you have a Windows PC with which you share files, it may be worth running anti-virus on your mac to prevent yourself from unintentionally spreading Windows viruses (which are otherwise harmless to Macs).
Note that all anti virus programs for mac are either a hoax or simply check for Windows viruses to prevent unintentional spreading of viruses while file sharing.

A: I personally use Sophos. The company I work for uses Sophos with 20,000+ computers, and the Mac version is free for consumer use. I have not had any problems with it running on my machines. It scans relatively quickly, and runs faster & better than any Norton product I've ever used. 

A: Viruses are so 80's. The big money is user information, this is where big companies make a lot of money, like Google Ads. Also Known As Spyware. 
Viruses started as a joke, a prank, a way for coders to have fun. Viruses flourished on Microsoft platforms like DOS and Windows because Microsoft never really cared about its customers other than how to sell more and make more money. 
MacOS X is a Unix based OS. Unlike Windows, a file cannot do whatever it wants. If it tries to modify your hard disk in any way, outside the home folder, it needs permissions. Permission you give. That makes life, for a virus, seriously hard. Because the goal of a virus is not just to infect your files, that means nothing, it's there to infect your system to infect your OS. To take control of your OS. That's the end goal. 
It's not impossible to hack an OS like MacOS X, but Apple is not stupid and, unlike Microsoft, it cares - because safety and reliability is what it sells. 
I have owned an iMac for 7 years and I've never had the problems I had with Windows. I see little reason to install a piece of software that will slow down my CPU and offer me zero benefits. 
There is no such thing as safety, safety is an illusion. As a matter of fact I have caught viruses on Windows several times using an anti-viruses that was full updated. 
If you want real safety, disconnect from the internet and install nothing. This is the only way to be sure. 
What seriously annoys me, and one of the big reasons I left Windows for good, was that Microsoft created this culture of ""getting a virus is what happens for an OS"" like its something normal. It's not normal, it's a serious flaw in the design of the OS, a flaw that survives because customers tolerate it as ""normal"". 
Do not install anti-viruses, you paid for your OS, demand from its publisher to deliver an OS that does what is reasonable to expect to keep you and your files safe. Viruses and malware are unacceptable. 

A: 
Do you need an Antivirus Software on OS X?
Yes, yes you do need some sort of antivirus app for your Mac OS X and my reason for saying that is simple. Viruses exist for every known Operating System. It is true that Apple’s Operating system for Macs is safer and more naturally protected against Viruses but the REAL truth is that Mac systems are not as popular as the Windows OS so those that make viruses don’t see a need to program viruses for Macs when most desktop users in the world still operate on a Windows OS. So my point is, it is better to get a good Antivirus for your Mac computer now because sooner or later, as OS X becomes more user friendly, more and more viruses will appear...

That's how I look at it too, you can never be too safe."|"Q: Is it generally advisable to get anti-virus software for Mac OS X? Is it worth to buy an anti-virus software for Mac OS X?
I heard both opinions like ""it's not possible to get a virus on Mac OS X"" and ""Mac OS X is also vulnerable against virus... ""
Which is true? What is the accepted practice, if any? Under what circumstances would anti-virus be advisable?

A: The short answer is that it depends on your particular needs and usage scenario.
The longer answer is that while Mac OS X is generally quite secure by default, it's still possible for malicious software to run on your computer, which could harm your computer or even steal your personal information. As such, some people choose to use anti-virus software to help protect their computers.
On the other hand, using anti-virus software can also have drawbacks, such as potentially slowing down your computer or causing false positives. Furthermore, if you're running a Mac, you may not need to worry as much about malware, as Mac OS X is generally less susceptible to malware than Windows.
In general, it's a good idea to be vigilant about security, but whether or not you choose to use anti-virus software is a personal decision."|0.3379359543323517|0.08635235732009927

Tuaw

There are Apps like GoDocs that claim to make the experience better, but I haven't tried them myself.
If you don't have an iPad (and I'm presuming you haven't because you're asking this question!) you can get your Mac or PC to pretend to be an iPad in Safari and try it out yourself. Fire up Safari's preferences and tick the show develop menu under the Advanced Tab:

A: Current situation is much better than the one sketched in the answer of Tuaw although some essentials are still missing.
Basic editing works, including font types, headers, bullets, numbering. So you can definitely write a nice piece of text. Compared to the desktop browser experience however, many features are missing. Tabs can only be inserted with an external keyboard, tables cannot be created at all (viewing and editing the contents of an existing table is possible), multiple columns is impossible, etc. It is impossible to use the desktop version of Google Docs in a browser on an iPad.

*If I try to go to login to MobileMe (at me.com), the MobileMe site sees that I'm on a mobile device, and won't open, routing me instead to the app store to get the mobileme gallery app, which is for the iphone, and scales pictures in a totally ridiculous way on the ipad.

A big bonus would be if it's also allowing hierarchical tag structures.

A: While it won't satisfy the hierarchical feature you'd like, the Grouping (or even the Comment) field in iTunes could be used to hold tags. Ideally you would want to do something to make the tag always unique by separating by a comma or say <> around the word. You can then use a Smart Playlist to filter for this tag. (Grouping contains).
There is an unfinished program called QuickTag that leverages that ability and makes it easier to tag.
There is also a hint on MacOSXHints.com that shows how you can grab Last.FM's tags and apply them to the current playing track. You'll need to modify their script slightly - namely to use the grouping or comment field (and match anything special you've done, eg. <>s around the word) instead of the genre. The alternative Perl version worked faster than the original script for me."|"Extreme, but I would love to see a feature like that in iTunes.

911||"Q: Should I stick with programming on my Apple or switch to Linux? I was wondering whether or not the switch to Linux would be worth it.  I feel like programming on my MacBook Pro is fine and I was wondering what the advantages would be for staying or switching.
What would you do and why?

A: Considering OS X is a POSIX compliant unix system, you can do most of yout *nix programming on OS X anyway.
I would stick with Apple, it is a growing market and has some very good tools to help you along the way.

A: I program for both Mac OS X and Linux, and I agree with bromfiets - try both of them!
As somebody else has suggested, put a VM on your Mac and load up Ubuntu and give it a whirl. I do some of my Linux work that way, using VMWare on a Mac Pro. (I also program on a MacBook with Snow Leopard, and a Sony laptop that runs Ubuntu.)
User322 is quite wrong about how ""effectively no difference between programming on a Mac or a Linux box"". If you want to write GUI programs on a Mac, your best bet these days is to use Cocoa and Objective C, and on most Linux distros it's C with GTK+. (Most of the others others, you'd use C and KDE, and on a few, C++ and Qt.) The graphics and window management systems are radically"|"different... I could go on and on.
On Linux, if you don't like how some component operates, you can dig into the sources and fix them, which is usually not an option on the Mac. You learn a lot, and you can make pretty good money doing that! My day jobs during much of the last five years have involved mucking around with the internals of Linux components like the X server, GTK+, and Clutter, and I now turn down work doing that these days because there's so much demand and I'm overloaded.
Apple really pushes the use of Xcode on the Mac for both editing and builds, and it's pretty good. On Linux, there's no real standard. For editing, you've got various GUI tools (kate, gedit) and terminal-based editors (vi/vim, emacs). For builds, you can do the command-line make thing, or use jam, or ant. Or you can go with an IDE like Eclipse, which is about as close as you'll find to Xcode, and in some ways is better. You get most of these tools for your Mac, but hardly anybody uses them there.
Mac and Linux programming are really different worlds, and both of them are pretty cool.
And while I like the Mac as a user... having attended WWDC off and on since the mid-80s, and also attended various Linux-oriented tech conferences like GUADEC and the Ottawa Linux Symposium... I'd attend the Linux ones over WWDC every time. They're just hackers' dreams, tons of fun, and they make the marketers stay away.

A: That depends on what your problems are with your mac and whether Linux solves them.  Gotta give more detail than that, man.
Personally, I love my mac for development for a few reasons:


*

*Window management is great.  At work I have two decent monitors, but when I'm coding on my little 15"" MBP, having cmd-tab/cmd-` is great and Exposé is a godsend.

*I have a real unix command prompt to use for dev tasks, but still a user friendly system for more normal activities.  I feel OS X has a good balance between the strengths of Linux and Windows without the need to switch between the two.

*Apple is a well-supported system.  It's disadvantage is that at some levels, it can be difficult to customize it (in both hardware and software).  The upshot of that is that if something goes wrong, you have a huge community of developers and users using very similar setups, whereas with Linux has both a smaller and less homogeneous userbase.

*The mainstream mac development apps (Textmate comes to mind) tend to be better designed and more usable than their Linux counterparts.  Some would argue that this comes at the cost of power and control- however, most popular Linux apps can be run on OS X one way or another.

*Edit addition: Two-finger swipe scrolling.  Never realized how useful this was until I had to code for 6 months on a Thinkpad.


Disclaimer: Though I interact with *nix systems all the time, I've never used Linux extensively on the desktop.

A: I suggest to not switch, but use both OS X and Linux. You will get more experience and learn to program in more than one ""environment"". Similary, don't stick to one single programming language. Try another one (at least).

A: Since OS X is unix-based, there's effectively no difference between programming on a Mac or a Linux box. It boils down simply to what programs and utilities (text editors, database frontends, etc) you prefer. But the Mac has infinitely better programs in this sense (at least in my humble opinion), and what utilities Linux does have are generally available on the Mac as well. Long and short, the only good reason to program on a Linux box when you have a Mac available is when you're developing an application for Linux. For everything else, just stick with your Mac."|"different.

A: There's no delete mechanism in the App Store. You can use a normal app-removal procedure to get rid of it. Apps leave config information and what not lying around that's outside of the .app container, so just dragging the .app container to the trash doesn't uninstall it completely. An uninstaller app like TrashMe will find and remove most of the little bits apps strew about your profile.

A: If you have Lion, then you can also hold down the option key in Launchpad; the icons will start to wiggle and show little x's on all the App Store installed apps very much like iOS does. Click the x and confirm the deletion and it will be the equivalent of dragging it to the trash from Finder; which means supporting preference files, etc. still remain, but for most users that should be of no concern."|"any other app?

A: Would iTunes Home Sharing work for you?

A: When the iTunes Store music was DRM'ed, this was a problem.

917||"Q: Can you install two versions of an app on the same iOS device? Is it possible to install two versions of an app on the same iPhone and, if so, how?
The scenario would be that you have purchased an app, and a recent update has changed some of the features--not necessarily for the better or worse, but enough of a change that you'd like to still be able and use the older version at times. You could downgrade from a backup, but it'd be nice to have the new version at times as well. Is it possible to have two versions of an app be 'seen' as different apps so that they can both be transferred to the iPhone at the same time? 

A: It's not so much the name -- at least not the visible one, as an upgrade can change the visible name -- but it's the bundle identifier inside the app that identifies it and allows the OS to know it's supposed to perform an upgrade. The developer has to keep the bundle identifier the same in order to actually provide an upgrade and not a new app, so no, you're out of luck.*
*Note that there may well be some way to do such a thing if you jailbreak your device, but I have no firsthand knowledge"|"of such.

A: It is possible to install 2 versions of the same app on your device. However, you're the one who gotta edit the .ipa, and it will lose its online features, like syncing with Facebook or something else.

""but it's the bundle identifier inside the app that identifies it and allows the OS to know it's supposed to perform an upgrade. The developer has to keep the bundle identifier the same in order to actually provide an upgrade and not a new app""

You can edit the bundle identifier, and here's a guide on how to do it:
Let's suppose you have the version 2.0 of the app installed on your device, and you want the version 1.0 also.

*You'll need those following programs on your computer: ""WinRAR"", ""plist Editor Pro"" and ""iFunbox"" (the last one is to install the older version of the app on your device)

*Download the version 1.0 of the app (.ipa file) from the internet.

*Search for an app that you would NEVER want to download, it doesn't matter what it is, and download its .ipa .

*Open this last .ipa with WinRAR.

*There will be a folder called ""Playload"", open it.

*There will be a folder with the name of the app, open it.

*Double click (to open) the file ""Info.plist"".

*Search for <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>.

*Under it, there will be the identifier, for example: <string>com.company.appname</string>.

*Copy this ""com.company.appname"".

*Close the file.

*Now open your app's older version's .ipa with WinRAR.

*There will be a folder called ""Playload"", open it.

*There will be a folder with the name of the app, open it.

*Double click (to open) the file ""Info.plist"".

*Search for <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>.

*Under it, there will be the identifier, for example: <string>com.2company2.2appname2</string>.

*Replace this ""com.2company2.2appname2"" with the one you've copied earlier.

*That will make your device think it's another app, and not simply replace the one you had with the one you'll install.

*Save and close the file.

*If WinRAR asks if you want to make the modifications, press YES.

*Now open iFunbox, and plug your device into the computer (close iTunes if it pops up).

*On the top left hand corner, press ""iFunbox Classic"".

*On the left, open ""Connected Devices"", then open your device's name (for example, ""Johnny | New iPad on USB""), then open ""User Applications"".

*On the top, click ""Install App"", and select the .ipa you've just modified.

*Wait for it to install. Make sure the device has its lights off (locked).

*Enjoy the 2 versions of the app on your device :)


But again, don't forget this disables the online features of the app, because of the bundle identifier change. Also be careful not to install the app from Step 3 as this will cause an upgrade.
That's the only way I could figure out to do this. There may be other ways.

A: No, it’s not possible to install two versions of an app that has the same name. You’d have to ask the developer to rename it, which I doubt he’ll be willing to do. Although the iOS doesn’t really check “the name” (like a file manager would do), the develop would have to create another “build” if I am not mistaken.
So you’re out of luck. Either embrace the new features or find an alternative. :)

A: Mine just gave me to versions of the same app without jailbreaking or using the computer i just go iOS 7.1 and i git two copies :)"|"Q: Can you install two versions of an app on the same iOS device? Is it possible to install two versions of an app on the same iPhone and, if so, how?
The scenario would be that you have purchased an app, and a recent update has changed some of the features--not necessarily for the better or worse, but enough of a change that you'd like to still be able and use the older version at times. You could downgrade from a backup, but it'd be nice to have the new version at times as well. Is it possible to have two versions of an app be 'seen' as different apps so that they can both be transferred to the iPhone at the same time? 

A: It is possible to install two versions of an app on the same iOS device, but not in the way you're asking. What you're asking about is a ""side-loading"" workaround for getting apps onto your device that have not been approved by the Apple App Store. This is not a supported or recommended way to install apps, and it is not clear to me how you would go about doing this.
The proper way to install apps on an iOS device is through the App Store, which is a curated and supported way. If you want to install an app that is not available on the App Store, you can contact the app developer directly and ask them to submit the app to the App Store. If you are the developer of an app and want to make it available to users on iOS devices, you can submit your app to the App Store.
If you are looking for a way to install an app that has been updated and you want to downgrade to an older version, you can contact the app developer to request a downgrade. You can also contact Apple support to ask them how to downgrade an app.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."|0.4290175437927246|0.18518518518518515

I know I can expand the delay before it will dim in the system preferences, but are there any way of automatically disable it when watching video?

A: You could use a software like Caffeine to easily achieve your need :
Caffeine is a tiny program that puts an icon in the right side of your menu bar. Click it to prevent your Mac from automatically going to sleep, dimming the screen or starting screen savers. Click it again to go back. Right-click (or ⌘-click) the icon to show the menu.

919||"Q: Is it possible to run Nautilus on OS X? Is it possible to run Nautilus instead of Finder on Mac OS X Snow Leopard? How?

A: Looks like it's available in MacPorts, so you could install MacPorts and then install Nautilus using that:
sudo port install nautilus  

You should then be able to run it using the nautilus terminal command.

You may see the following during installation:
############################################################################
# Startup items have been generated that will aid in
# starting dbus with launchd. They are disabled
# by default. Execute the following command to start them,
# and to cause them to launch at startup:
#
# sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.freedesktop.dbus-system.plist
# launchctl load -w"|"/Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist
############################################################################

Running the commands manually should be enough to run nautilus directly after installation (without rebooting).

A: While Josh's answer regarding MacPorts addresses how to install nautilus, it doesn't address how to run it ""instead of Finder"". In the other answer(s), there seemed to be some confusion about whether it would be possible to prevent the Finder from running.
Unlike an application such as the Dock, the Finder isn't considered a ""required"" application. For example, if you were to write an AppleScript to the effect of tell application ""Dock"" to quit""and then run it, the loginwindow would immediately re-launch the Dock, since it assumes the Dock must always be running. With the Finder, however, as long as you quit it in a way that allows OS X to know that you had a clear intent to do that, the loginwindow won't relaunch it.
To do that, all you need to do is simply tell the Finder to quit rather than trying to kill it. When you kill the Finder forcibly by using the Force-Quit option or by using kill or killall in Terminal, loginwindow (or launchd for your user account) will immediately try to relaunch it because it saw that it terminated ""unexpectedly"".
Telling the Finder to quit via an Apple Event won't result in it automatically being relaunched.
[EDIT]: In more recent versions of macOS, as I mentioned in this answer, it's possible to prevent the Finder from running by running the following command in Terminal:
launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Finder.plist
Alternatively, in older versions of OS X, an AppleScript like the following could be run at login to quit the Finder:
property runningApps : {}
property assureQuitMenuItem : true

tell application ""System Events"" to set runningApps to name of every application process

if (runningApps contains ""Finder"") then
    tell application ""Finder"" to quit
end if

if (assureQuitMenuItem) then
    set quitMenuItem to missing value
    try
        set quitMenuItem to (do shell script ""/usr/bin/defaults read com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem"")
    on error
        set quitMenuItem to ""0""
    end try
    if quitMenuItem = ""0"" then
        do shell script ""/usr/bin/defaults write com.apple.finder QuitMenuItem 1""

  </dict>
</plist>

When I execute /opt/local/bin/couchdb manually, the process is created, so no problems there. It just seems the launch daemon skips this command.
Any thoughts on how to fix this?

A: Try the following (one-line command) :
sudo chown -R couchdb:couchdb /opt/local/var/lib/couchdb/ /opt/local/var/log/couchdb/ /opt/local/etc/couchdb/ /opt/local/var/run/couchdb

Then reboot.
If it doesn't work, what version of MacPorts and CouchDB do you have ?

A: I'm not specifically familiar with CouchDB, but I see a couple of potential problems with your .plist file: first, the HOME value being set is weird -- it should be a specific folder path (i.e. wherever you put the couchdb user's home folder), not ~.  Second, I suspect you also need to set the PATH environment variable so CouchDB can find the other optional programs you've installed.  So that section of the .plist should look something like this:
<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
<dict>
    <key>HOME</key>
    <string>/usr/local/var/lib/couchdb</string>
    <key>PATH</key>
    <string>/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin</string>
</dict>

(Note: the above values are guesses based on a little googling -- you may need to adjust them to where your CouchDB user's home is and/or where your add-on binaries folders are.)  To load the changed .plist file, use:
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.couchdb.plist

If that doesn't solve the problem, there are a couple of places to look for more info about what's going wrong: first, take a look at the system log (/var/log/system.log), either with the Console utility or a command line tool; it'll have any errors that launchd ran into while trying to process the .plist file or start CouchDB.  Second, follow Mark's suggestion about changing StandardOutPath and StandardErrorPath to real files, and looking at what shows up there.  This isn't needed if everything's configured properly, but can be very useful for finding out what's wrong when there's a problem (and you can switch them back to /dev/null after the problem has been solved)."|"<array>

1 Yes, they're both me.

A: You can use this script in the HEAD section of your index file.
<script type=""text/javascript"">
        var agent=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();
        var is_iphone = (agent.indexOf('iphone')!=-1);

</script>

and redirect your visitor to iPhone compatible page. See an example on http://www.barisoztekin.com

A: You can do it from the environment settings passed to a CGI or app called by the server. The HTTP_USER_AGENT field describes the client connecting to the server, and is what is often used to branch or redirect based on a particular browser.
The downside to sensing with that is it can be spoofed and/or changed in a lot of client software. 

A: Typically this is done server side by evaluating the User Agent that is passed with the HTTP request. I believe iWeb just publishes static pages and doesn't support dynamic content. In that case you will probably need to resort to using JavaScript so that the redirect is performed client side.
Be careful when using this approach though as it has the potential to create a poor user experience. It would be best to establish a way to allow the user to view the page if they really want to. Typically this is done with a cookie if the user selects that they want the 'normal' site rather than the 'mobile' one."|"Q: How do I detect an iPhone user on my website?

I've never gotten more than one of these from any other individual service, ever.  It's getting pretty annoying with the Apple ones, though.
Short of deleting my Apple account altogether, is there any way to stop this?

A: If you're getting these, it might mean someone is trying to hack into your Apple account. And they don't know your password. Though they would be stupid to keep pressing the Reset link unless they're also trying to hack into your email account to get"|"the email too. I don't assume the emails come with an IP of the computer sending the request? Maybe you could contact Apple and see if someone on an outside IP is trying to access your stuff.

A: You can stop getting these emails by switching your account to two-step authentication now that iCloud and Apple ID support that. Do keep in mind, that if you receive that email, someone (or some bot / computer script) is telling Apple to begin the reset procedure for your account and if they happen to have compromised any step in the email chain between you and Apple - they can take control of your account.
You'll no longer have security questions to ask and Apple will never allow the password to be reset via emails from iForgot.apple.com. You'll instead get a SMS code (or iMessage) to a trusted iOS device or use your recovery key and current password to reset the password going forward.

Are there alternative ways to pay for apps, without resorting to someone else's credit card?

A: The iTunes store accepts Paypal, so if you can get money to Paypal you're all set.  I'm pretty sure Paypal has many ways to get money to them (mail them a check, give them your account number, etc.).
The trick seems to be that"|"you have to sign up in iTunes on your Mac/PC -- the App Store on my iPod doesn't have Paypal as an option.

A: I don't know if this is applicable to your country, but in Germany, Apple sells iTunes apps cards especially for buying apps in the app store.

A: Many supermarkets and grocery stores sell pre-paid gift cards. You can purchase a Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc, gift card with cash, check, etc, at these supermarkets and then use the number on the front wherever they ask for a credit card number.
(This method is actually a preferred method for the security-conscience as well. Reason: if someone gets ahold of your card number they can only take the small amount of money that you have loaded onto the card. This provides confidence for those worried about entering their card number online.)

931||"Q: Why is my MacBook Pro constantly losing the wifi connection with my WRT150N router? My Macbook is constantly losing its wifi connection. Sometimes it has trouble connecting, other times it connects, but I obtain a server not found error. It seems to work reasonably well at work, but it can't obtain a connection at home even when I am extremely close to the router. Until recently, I used to only have wifi connection problems occasionally. My android phone seems to be able to connect to wifi without problem.

A: If you are certain that your Wi-Fi connection works fine when you are somewhere else, there might be signal or compatibility problems between your router and your Macbook Pro. Contrary to popular belief, wi-fi connections are not a voodoo thing, and they just involve radio waves, just like a cellphone and any other wireless device. 
Reasons for a Wi-Fi connection being lost could be quite a lot, but usually interference and"|"signal noise are the two primary factors. Where some devices are able to “maintain” the connection (despite the possible errors), others simply fail and drop it more often. 
Wi-Fi is designed to continue working despite “small interruptions” (albeit with a decrease in performance due to ‘retries’), but sometimes this is not possible and connections get dropped. 
Sometimes the problem relies in the encryption. When the network is not open and it’s traffic is encrypted, this “overhead” causes more drops than the usual.
Possible solutions are resetting the router to factory settings and reconfiguring it, changing the channel from Auto to something allowed in your country, making sure your Operating system / Computer has the latest drivers/patches/etc. and there isn’t really much else you can do.
You can try moving your router to another physical position.
I’ve read a few posts about that specific router model and Macbooks having problems, so also assume there might be a problem with that model (or some revision of the router) and OS X.
You can always try to see if the Console has some relevant error messages (/Applications/Utilities/Console.app).

A: Try using iStumbler to detect and identify neighboring and overlapping wireless access points (WAPs).  It's likely an interference issue that can be solved with vigilance.  You need to find out what channels your neighbor's WAPs are using, and then switch your router to use the least crowded channel you can find.
Ideally you want to use channels 1, 6, or 11.  These are the channels that have the most leeway when it comes to other channels interfering with their signal.  Wifi devices operating on a particular channel can interfere with other devices operating on channels up to 5 steps away.  The amount of interference grows logarithmically with signal strength and channel proximity.  
For example, if you are using channel 1 and your nearest neighboring wireless network is also using channel 1, you are receiving a large amount of interference.  If you are on 1 and the other network is on 6, the interference is negligible.  However, if you are on channel 1 and your neighbor is using channel 3, you are likely still on the receiving end of a huge amount of interference depending on their WAPs signal strength.
iStumbler will give you information about the signal strengths emanating from the other interfering WAPs, and from there you can infer the best channel to use.  You may need to periodically perform the same task as your neighbors change their wifi channels.

A: I also have the same issues but with WRT160N.. I will try to reset it to factory settings and will test it again.
@Martin Thanks for the answer, I have one Q. I setup my router when I had a Windows Laptop, then I moved to new place and bought MacBook. Is reset thing is same both pn PC & Mac ?"|"signal strength are the main culprits. 

I would suggest you try to troubleshoot your router and your Macbook Pro one by one, and see if you can find the problem. If you have a Windows computer, you might be able to use a free software called ""InSSIDer"" to scan for wireless networks and see if you can find your router's name. If you have a Macbook Pro, I would suggest you try to connect to your router's wi-fi network using the terminal: 

sudo route

This will show you the route of your computer to your router. If you have an android phone, you can use it to connect to your router's wi-fi network and see if your Macbook Pro can connect to it. 
If you have a Windows computer, you can use a free software called ""Wi-Fi Analyzer"" to see if your router is broadcasting its name. 
If you have a Macbook Pro, you can use the terminal to connect to your router: 

sudo nc -l 25000 

This will connect your computer to your router on port 25000. If you can connect to your router, you can use the terminal to ping your router:

932||"Q: Is it normal for it to take hours to delete a Time Capsule ""sparsebundle"" I'm trying to make room on my time capsule to make backups (it currently tells me it's full).  
I got help in this question with how to delete individual backups, but it didn't solve the problem.   Even after I'd deleted all the backups Time Machine sees, I still have a ~700GB sparsebundle on the time capsule.
So, I'm trying to manually delete it, but it doesn't appear to be making progress.  I had this for about an hour:

and then it switched to this:

I realize that might seem like progress, but note the lack of blue filling up the progress bar.  It's been like that for hours now.
Is this normal?  Is there a better way?
Note that I really don't want to reformat the TC because I have other files that I've manually saved there, plus my wife's TC backups.
EDIT: Nothing was happening.  It was apparently too much for Wifi.  Once I connected via"|"ethernet, I was able to delete, but it took the better part of a day.

A: It is theoretically possible if the drive is near full that a delete operation may take a lot of time. You can try to delete the file via the command line, which bypasses the Finder and does it the Unix way. 
In any case there must be hard drive activity during the process. If the drive is not making any noise or light, then it’s not doing anything and that’s not good. But be patient. 

A: It is absolutely normal.  If you were to examine the .sparsebundle disk image that Time Machine stores data in, it consists of tens of thousands of files inside a sort of camouflaged folder.  Deleting an individual file takes a relatively short period of time, but that time adds up quickly especially when you're accessing those files over a comparatively slow interface like WiFi.

A: Similarly to others, Time Machine made an excessively large .sparsebundle file (650GB) on my Seagate GoFlex drive, labeled .purgeable. Then Time Machine stopped backing up. Out of room. Purgeable file was never purged. Now I know to have at least twice the size of my original data available on the backup drive.
I wanted to delete the .sparsebundle. Manual file deletion didn't work; the ""Deleting .sparsebundle"" process went on for 6 days, ending with the extremely unhelpful [ The operation can’t be completed because the item “bands” is in use. ] Other forums suggested using Disk Utility or AirPort Utility to re-format; but neither app could see the wifi drive. 
Only by going to the online GoFlex drive setup app was re-formatting finally a success. 
PART 1
https://www.seagateshare.com/ - log in as admin

Preferences > Administration > Storage Devices
  Select the Hard drive, choose option Format and wait until it finishes. Even with a red error message, check the drive space result - mine worked anyway.
  Presto - clean hard drive, all information erased as if unboxing for the first time.

PART 2
'OSStatus error' may appear when you try to assign the drive in Time Machine. Unbelievably, setting up a secondary account via the GoFlex Home app fixes it.
GoFlex Home Agent > File > Open GoFlex Home > Preferences > Administration > New User
Just don't use any previous user account credentials and don't really ever use this to log on to the drive.
Voila. Drive ready to be re-assigned for Time Machine backup.

Sorry to those who don't want to re-format your drive. This solution is only good for returning the drive to zero. If you don't have a Seagate, but have a similar .sparsebundle Time Machine problem, perhaps your drive also has an online app re-format option at the manufacturer's site."|Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

I'm not talking about an account for a system process or daemon, I mean is there any way to add a user account, change, user real names, icons, FileVault protection, Admin/normal/limited user status, and basically do everything else that can be done in the System|"Preferences Users preference pane, but via some command line utility?

A: Solution by @Infamy seems to be for 10.5.
On OS X 10.6 each line needs to be changed to look like the following:
sudo dscl localhost -create /Local/Default/Users/addusername

That is, replace / by localhost, prepend /Local/Default to /Users and invoke the entire command with sudo.

A: To create an account in the Users folder
dscl / -create /Users/addfromcli

Create and set the shell property to bash.
dscl / -create /Users/addfromcli UserShell /bin/bash

Create and set the user’s full name. (Displayed in some of the panels/login screen)
dscl / -create /Users/addfromcli RealName ""Added From Cli""

Create and set the user’s ID. (this is the unique id, you need to find out what id your last user create was and add one)
dscl / -create /Users/addfromcli UniqueID 503

Create and set the user’s group ID property. (This can be your default group)
dscl / -create /Users/addfromcli PrimaryGroupID 1000

Create and set the user home directory.
dscl / -create /Users/addfromcli NFSHomeDirectory /Local/Users/addfromcli

This is the model with the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M video card.  This MacBook Pro should support the higher resolution of the 30 inch model (2500x1600 res), but...
How do I add the older 24"" monitor (1900x1200 res) into the mix?  
The laptop stays closed, but technically this is 3 screens. The older monitor only supports DVI and VGA inputs.  I have read about several USB to DVI converters on Amazon, most with mixed reviews.

Thanks everyone for the helpful answers.  
Thanks Martin, but the"|"Matrox is unsuitable for my setup as I have one 2500x1600 and one 1900x1200 monitor. The Matrox website says ""maximum resolutions of dual 1920x1200 and triple 1360x768 under Mac"" and I've read elsewhere that both resolutions need to be the same.
John, Thanks for the tips - that is indeed what I settled on; a Kensington USB to DVI Converter (with DisplayLink 195 chipset).
My additions to your suggestions:


*

*Definitely use the latest drivers, even if beta. I had a major problems with the DisplayLink 1.5 drivers when trying to resume from sleep. The 1.6b3 drivers fixed that.

*You cannot use the Mac built in screen capture on the USB monitor.  No biggie, but it tripped me up until I figure out that was the issue. 
Rock on.

A: A new product has been announced today about this. On the Windows side, the Matrox DualHead/TripleHead were common, but not available for Mac. 
That has recently changed because Matrox Introduces New Mac-Friendly DualHead2Go DP and TripleHead2Go DP Multi-Monitor Adapters.

A: I use a USB to DVI adapter based on the DisplayPort line of products with my MacBook Pro (2007 running Snow Leopard 10.6).  Overall, I am quite happy with it however there are a few things you should note:


*

*It does not support hardware acceleration so certain programs, such as iMovie, will refuse to launch when the device is plugged into your computer.  iMovie is the only program that I have come across that is affected but I mainly do web development and work in PhotoShop.

*At this time, the DisplayPort drivers do not support color profiles.  Your only option for color calibrating your monitor will be whatever manual controls your monitor comes with.  It's not a deal breaker for me as I mainly edit text but if you are color correcting photos it could be a problem.

*Small youtube videos play pretty well but you won't want to use the monitor for anything like fullscreen playback.  It will work, but the results will be pretty choppy.

*Make sure you are on a USB2 hub or directly plugged into a USB port on your machine.  It won't run over anything slower.


You can find a link to my preferred vendor here, though any product with Mac Drivers based on the newer chipset (resolution higher than 1080p) will work:
http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Newer%20Technology/VIDU2DVIA/
Don't buy an adapter that uses DisplayPort if it does not specifically say it will work on a Mac.

From : https://superuser.com/questions/196562/how-to-connect-to-an-afp-server-from-a-windows-pc
(I don't know how to migrate my question to here...)

A: Installing Bonjour (aka Zeroconf) doesn't help. Bonjour only announces existing services.
If the server only serves AFP the client needs to understand AFP. The only Windows AFP client I knew was PC MacLan (http://store.ca.com/miramar/miramar.aspx) which seems not to be sold any more. (I still have it installed on an XP box.)
The often cited Microsoft Services for Macintosh was just an AFP server for Windows NT Server.
I think there were efforts at some time to create a FUSE driver as an AFP client on Linux which could in principle be ported to OSX but I haven't heard of that in a long time.

Also, what's the significance of the word ""Remote"" in the setting name? Are there images that will load which aren't remote?

Say you would like a smart playlist that contains all tracks from Bob Dylan or the Beatles with a score of 3 stars or better.
Without hierarchical rules you only have the options of getting the tracks that match all or any of your rules.

It seems that nested rules exist since iTunes 9; see also a screenshot.

By default, it creates a smart playlist that includes all tracks that match the criteria you specify. You can then add additional conditions to further refine the playlist.

For example, if you wanted to create a smart playlist that included only songs from a specific artist, you could start with a basic smart playlist that included all tracks from that artist, and then use the ""..."" button to add additional criteria, such as a date range or song rating. This would result in a more specific smart playlist that includes only the songs from that artist that meet the additional criteria.

In contrast, the ""+"" button in the ""Edit Smart Playlist"" dialog is used to add a new condition to the smart playlist.

My goal is to have two users on one computer, so I can let my brother to play/chat anything while I do my job. If we have two monitors, then I don't need to buy a new computer.
If you know of some software that can do this, please let me know.

A: You can achieve something very close to this with a virtual PC solution. I tried it with Parallels. For simplicity I'll assume you run Mac OS X on the ""real"" computer and Windows in Parallels (of course you can run another OS too, I just picked one to keep the story simple).
In the Parallels settings, you can choose which USB devices should be connected to the Mac and which to Windows. If you connect your external keyboard and mouse to Windows, you get a warning that this will disable input from them on the"|"Mac, but this is exactly what you want. Be sure to disable mouse pointer synchronization (in version 5 it's called ""SmartMouse""), otherwise you won't see the Windows mouse pointer.
Now you can use the external keyboard and mouse only in Windows, and the main keyboard and mouse anywhere. This is also useful if you want to override something your brother is doing :-)
Doing this in a Mac only environment is currently not possible because it would require changes in the window manager, which is part of the OS. There is a project that does this for the X window manager, but this will not work to control every window on your Mac. TeamPlayer is software that allows you to control Windows with multiple mice, but with the exception of their own programs, you control the computer in turns: only one mouse can give real clicks, the others must wait for their turn.
A complete solution is Userful, but this runs only on Linux, because, as I said, it requires modifications at different places in the software stack and only Linux is open enough to allow this. Microsoft created a similar project: Windows MultiPoint Server, but this is targets to schools and I doubt you can get it. And of course, it only runs on Windows.

A: Actually, its not that simple.
The calls software makes into the operating system assumes up to one keyboard and up to one mouse. Anything more would require the software know how to tell the difference between them.
I have heard of 'virtual' solutions for Windows that allow a PC to have its resources divided up to two sets of keyboard, mouse and monitor. I am unaware of such a solution for the Mac however.
If such software existed, I would still be wary of using it. The performance burden of two users at once may be worse than you would tolerate, especially if one is play a game and/or playing music as is implied in the question. In addition its cost, whether it be in the time to setup and maintain this two-headed machine or the funds to acquire software capable of this task, may be more than simply buying another computer.

A: macOS has screen sharing and can make two user accounts in system preferences. One for each of you.
Attach the second keyboard, mouse, display to an iPhone or iPad or raspberry pi or other low cost computer you own and when the second account connects, you will be asked if you want to share the same screen with your brother or start a second distinct virtual-only session.
I believe 10.7 OS X Lion was the first OS to support this.
Enjoy!

A: In a nutshell, this is not possible. User interaction with the Mac OS is assumed to be single user. Two input devices will function simultaneously, but you cannot render two cursors or have them function in parallel. The only way to have two users on one Mac is to provide accounts via netboot, which still requires separate hardware."|"Q: Can I have multiple mice & keyboards for one Mac?

One button is usually ""This Mac' (too broad) and the other one is a folder that has never been the one I want - in fact, I would want to exclude a particular folder (ie the Library folder in my user directory).
Since we are given a choice of 2 places to query, why not any particular branch of the directory?

A: Ok, there’s a way to “hack” into SmartFolders and change the locations. 
Rules: 


*

*You can’t do it from the UI

*It involves having the smart folder saved

*I wrote it in spanish"|"a long time ago in a blog post (spanish)


For the sake of helping you (I’m assuming you don’t speak spanish), I’ll transcribe the relevant information here. 
Please note that the blog explains how to add more than one location to the search, not how to exclude (something I don’t believe is possible).
So, the short version: 


*

*Save your smart folder, the search location is really not important (we’re going to change it!) but make sure you use the searching “terms” that you want. Name it something like: IHATESMARTFOLDERS. Ok, you can name it differently if ya wish ;)

*Go to your ~/Library/Saved Searches and you should see your saved smart folder. 

*Once you have located your smart Folder, you have to open it with a text editor like TextWrangler (or anything that can save Plain Text). Do not use Pages…

*Once you have it in your favorite editor, go to the end. You’ll see something like this: 



<key>FXScopeArrayOfPaths</key>
<array>
           <string>/Users/martin/Desktop</string>
</array>


Note My smart folder was created for searching on my Desktop.
Good. As you can see the path is in an Array. If you know something about arrays, you’ll know that they are a collection of items. This means we can go ahead and add more items to this particular collection:
For example: 
<key>FXScopeArrayOfPaths</key>
<array>
         <string>/Users/martin/Desktop</string>
         <string>/Users/martin/Pictures/MacStuff</string>
         <string>/Users/martin/Pictures/Me</string>
</array>

I have added two more folders to my smart -not so smart- folder. 
Now in order for this to start working you have to: 


*

*Save the smart folder (remember to use plain text!)

*Restart Finder. 


And voilà. 
Sadly, I haven’t found a way to exclude a location.  

A: There is a 3rd party app EasyFind which has more constraints and customizations for your searches. I use it much more than smart folders. EasyFind is free from the App Store."|"Yo no puedo hacerlo desde la interfaz, pero he encontrado una forma de hacerlo.

A: For 99% of applications: The green button in the top left of any OS X window is called the ""Zoom"" button and will resize the window to it's contents so long as it fits in the current resolution. This is the same as choosing Zoom from the Window menu. 
For programs such as iTunes that show a completely different mode when you choose Zoom, you can hold the option key when clicking the zoom button to force it to perform the normal zoom action instead of changing modes.

A: Hold down the option key while clicking on the green button.  This should prevent iTunes from changing to the mini-player, and will resize the window as expected.

A: There's an alternative. Use some app such as BetterTouchTool that enables you to resize windows in different ways. On BTT I choose Fn + Option to resize window on top of the mouse.


A: You should try a third party window management add on, it'll really suit your power user style.
Try Cinch, which is a shareware program that adds AeroSnap-like functionality to a mac (like that in windows 7, which allows you to drag a window to the top of the screen to make it maximize, or drag it to either side and make it consume exactly half the screen). 
Also Stay is a great app for setting specified locations for windows to exist, and have them be restored to that spot every time the display configuration changes or the app is open. (for example you could set your contact list to always be in the rightmost side consuming a small portion of the screen. Everytime ur IM app is opened or a screen is plugged in or unplugged, it'll move back to it's spot)
you can see some others i found online on this aricle

A: Starting with macOS Sierra, you can easily resize a window to fit the display. Move the mouse cursor to any edge of the window until it turns into a bi-directional arrow aligned diagonally (as-shown):

Now, press and hold the Option key and double click/tap to change the size of window to fit the screen."|iTunes when I disconnect from the external monitor?|0.36572355031967163|0.020671834625322995

A: YES! I have it currently on my iPhone 4. It's untethered for last-gen devices, but for the iPhone 4 it's a tethered jailbreak, which means that you'll have to connect it to your computer and use the program (redsn0w) to turn on the phone every time the phone gets"|"turned off or looses power. 
If you don't turn off your phone a lot, then it's not big issue, though. And because you have a 3GS, you'll be untethered anyway.
The jailbreak is at http://blog.iphone-dev.org which is the iPhone Dev Team, the MOST reputable source for iPhone jailbreaking. These are the actual people who do the work (or compile it from Geohot). DO NOT trust any info from places like BigBoss, RedmondPie, UltraPWN, or anyone else.

A: It is possible and it includes unlock. All you need is a simple tutorial, Redsn0w and the correspondent firmware. Unless of course you prefer to go the ""official"" way. I did it with iPhone 3G and the first tutorial.
The 3Gs got is the only device that marks the bootrom change. Basically all ""i devices"" are only able to get a (bad) tethered jailbreak if they're launched after a given point. Here's a long guide with steps on how to check your bootrom to see if you're lucky or not. I'll summarize it for both mac and PC:


*

*Put your iPhone in DFU mode (not recovery mode):


*

*Connect your iPhone to your computer.

*Turn iPhone off.

*Start iTunes.

*Hold Power and Home buttons together for 10 seconds or so.

*Release Power button but keep holding the Home button until your computer recognizes a new USB device.

*iTunes will now recognize your iPhone.



Note: Your iPhone screen at this time should be blank (black in color), if not, then you are most likely in Recovery Mode, not DFU mode.


*Locate the value [iBoot-359.3] or something alike under System Profiler (mac) or Device Manager (win). Keywords are: USB and Apple Mobile Device (DFU Mode).

*If the value after iBoot is 359.3 or lower, that's the old bootrom. Yippie!

I recently started using Git with GitHub and thus discovered that I already have a generated pair of SSH keys, public and private. This leads me to ask: what applications/programs/daemons on my Mac might have caused this keypair to be created? I've never used SSH to log in to another machine.

A: Amusingly, your own question includes the answer. GitHub for Mac uses Git via SSH, and will"|"automatically generate unprotected SSH key pairs (e.g. no passphrase) in order to push/pull contents between the remote repo and your local ones.

A: The program to create SSH key pairs is ssh-keygen. 
Enabling the SSH daemon in the Sharing preference pane does not create a key pair for a user in ~/.ssh/ The SSH daemon only creates a SSH host key pair in /etc/ssh_host*_key*
If you haven't used ssh-keygen to create the keys, maybe some other program did it for you. I don't know which one does that but I haven't used git.
As for using the keys, every program that uses SSH can use the keys. Some, like ssh, use the keys automatically, in some, like Cyberduck (SFTP), you have to select the key file manually.

A: To be honest the question is a little bit huge. Your ssh keys could have been generated if you activated the sshd (Remote Login) from the sharing preference pane; as to what could have used (or uses them), it’s any program (like Git, Subversion, SFTP, etc) that requires ssh access. Not sure exactly which one could have generated for you, but you can always remove them and see what fails (save a backup!).

A: Break out 
fs_usage(1)

or
opensnoop(1m)

(2010 MacBook Pro, OS X 10.6.5)

A: You want to set an Open Firmware Password. This makes it so that a thief needs a password to boot to another disk (or do anything other than a normal boot). This means that they can't reset your password from the OS disc and get in anyway. This is an important security measure to take. The only problem is that you can't do things like safe boots and verbose mode. Here is an article about how to set up the OF password (and how to reset a user password).
And here is a general article about physical and virtual options to increase security (ways to help locate a stolen Mac, make thieves think it's broken, or even just lock it to your desk).

A: Considering the other answers, and the possibility of not getting a laptop back, perhaps you need to consider using time machine for a backup, and put the target NAS somewhere not close to the laptop - like in a discrete cupboard with good wi-fi coverage, or a wired ethernet port. You should do this anyway - for the dozen other reasons that the data on one hard drive may become irretrievable.
That way, you can have reasonable drive encryption, as even with the OF password, it does not prevent them removing the drive and using it in another machine to retrieve interesting contents. Your bank details may be far more value to some thieves than a working MBP depending on their level of sophistication.

A: I use and like Undercover by www.orbicule.com

A: Have you run the Apple Hardware Test that came with the MacBook Air?

To use Apple Hardware Test on your
  MacBook Air:
  
  
*
  
*Disconnect all external devices from your computer except the power
  adapter.
  
*Restart your MacBook Air while holding down the ""D"" key.
  
*When the Apple Hardware Test chooser screen appears, select the
  language for your location.
  
*Press the Return key or click the right arrow button.
  
*When the Apple Hardware Test main screen appears (after about 45
  seconds), follow the onscreen
  instructions.
  
*If Apple Hardware Test detects an issue, it displays an error code. Make
  a note of the error code before
  pursuing support options. If Apple
  Hardware Test doesn't detect a
  hardware issue, the issue may be
  software related.

If AHT found no issues, run a memory test. Download memtest86+ and burn that to a CD, and boot the MacBook Air from the CD. I have personally had RAM issues which AHT didn't find but memtest did.
EDIT: Sorry, I only just not noticed that you said you're unable to run AHT, presumably because you don't have an external optical drive. I'd recommend taking the MacBook Air in to an Apple store. Or by using a USB Ethernet Adapter you could probably get it to boot AHT from the network.
EDIT2: Have you tried booting from a USB drive? You could use another Mac to install a fresh copy of OS X to a US disk and see if the Air can boot that. or, you might be able to copy the Mac OS X Install DVD to a USB disk and try to run AHT off there...
Ultimately, a visit to the Apple Store is probably your best bet :-(

Is there a trusted 8GB(2x4) RAM upgrade for MacBook Pro 15"" 2.4Mhz Core i5?

A: I’ve always brought memory from OWC with success. 

A: I've always had good success with Crucial, but I can't speak to your specific case.

A: As long as this is branded stuff that went through testing, and not some chips that were sorted out / relabeled / rebranded, you usually don't have much issues with RAM these days.
However, RAM issues are still a major source of Macs behaving badly, so the most important  thing is to really check it.
No matter where and what you buy, make sure they take the RAM back if ""Memtest OS X"" fails during an extensive RAM test on your machine.
Now build in your new RAM, and run Memtest OS X (details i.e. at OSXDaily). 
The tests will need a couple of hours, and really put your RAM under stress. If all tests are running ok, you are fine, if not, send the RAM back."|"if this is still the case, but I've also seen some reviews on Amazon for a 2x4GB kit from Crucial that says it works great on MacBook Pro 15"" 2.4Ghz Core i5.

Main advantage is you can choose RAM based on your model/ make of the year etc...

A: Once you figure out what brand(s) of memory you're looking for, the place to start shopping is DealRAM.com.
You put in what computer you have, and it'll tell you what your options are and where to buy at the best price.

A: I'm surprised no one has mentioned RamJet for Apple memory. Their prices are good, shipping is excellent and their web site is optimized for eliminating mistakes in ordering the incorrect memory. 
I find their site to be the best reference on the web for rapidly finding the memory needs for any Mac bar none - even Apple's on-line documentation pales in comparison to RamJet for memory specifications or planning an upgrade.
They use pictures of the products and have very good descriptions to figure out exactly what mac you own. I've made perhaps 8 purchases from them and shipping, returns and customer support are top notch. I do regret buying from one of the ""cheapest"" vendors linked above when the product they sold didn't work and they charged me incorrectly for the return / exchange. It eventually got sorted, but I'll never get back the time and effort to clear up their mistakes on that one order.
Do your homework on what happens if you need support down the road and know the time periods for returns / warranty / support if you care. I'm more value sensitive than price sensitive but RamJet is generally very competitive on price as well.

iTunes does recognize the iPhone, but when I select 'restore', it goes through a few progress bars, then errors again. I've already tried to hard reset the phone, but that doesn't work either.

A: Please note that the instructions I am giving are assuming you are using an English copy of Windows, since I do not have a Mac and therefore do not have much experience with them.  However, the steps will be very similar, and I will try to note where things might be different for Mac OS X.
First, check all of the following:


*

*Make sure your copy of iTunes is up-to-date. In Windows, open iTunes, click ""Help"", then ""Check for Updates"".

*Make sure you are connected to the internet and the connection is reliable.  iTunes contacts Apple several times during the restore procedure, and if iTunes fails to get a response during"|"one of these check-ins, the restore will fail.

*Make sure you are using the correct version of iTunes for your system.  If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, you will need to install the 64-bit version of iTunes.  If you have Windows XP, you need the normal 32-bit version. If you have Vista or Windows 7, click the start orb, right-click computer, then click ""Properties"". In the ""System"" section, look for the line that starts with ""System Type"". If it says 32-bit, use the normal iTunes installer. If it says ""64-bit Operating System"", download the 64-bit version of iTunes from http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1047  (If you have trouble determining whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit copy of Windows installed, try installing iTunes using http://www.ninite.com and it will automatically download the right version)

*Delete the restore files from your computer. In Windows, press WindowsKey+R, type '%appdata%\apple computer\itunes' then delete the folders iPod Software Update and iPhone Software update if they exist.  If you are using OS X, the folder should be ~/Library/iTunes/.

*If it still isn't working, uninstall iTunes, reboot, then install iTunes again, then reboot again.


If none of the above work, do the following to place your iPhone into DFU mode.  Some people have better luck with restoring with this method.


*

*Plug the iPhone into the computer, and wait for it to be recognized in iTunes.

*Press and hold the home and sleep buttons.

*As soon as the iPhone screen goes blank, count to six seconds. At six, release the sleep button, and continue holding the home button.

*You should see or hear the new hardware notification on your computer. When you do, you can release the home button.  If the new hardware notification, wait until iTunes recognizes it and tells you it found an iPhone in restore mode.

*The iPhone screen should be blank. If it shows the ""Connect to iTunes"" screen, unplug it, then try again from step 1.


A: If you see Connect to iTunes screen when you start iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch 
In some situations, you might see the Connect to iTunes screen when you start your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. When this happens, your device is in recovery mode. Here's what to do.
Restart your device by pressing and holding the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time until you see the Apple logo.
If you see the Connect to iTunes screen again, you'll need to reinstall iOS. Follow these steps:
1. Connect your device to your computer.
2. You should see this message: ""The software on [your device name] needs to be restored to factory settings or updated.""
3. Click Update to reinstall iOS while keeping your data.
Get help if, after following the steps above, you see a restore error.
If you don't see a restore error, but you still see the Connect to iTunes screen when you start your device, contact Apple.

969||"Q: Power adapter connection issues Lately, my Magsafe power adapter has not been connecting properly:


*

*The wires are not worn out as I take good care of them

*The issue happens when I try to connect my power adapter to my computer

*The LED does not come on and the MacBook does not get charged. I have to unplug and plug the power adapter several times until I can get a connection.

*The cord and computer intake seem clean and no pins are pushed down


What can I do?

A: Even if there isn't any obvious cable damage or bulging, the adapter could be failing. If the adapter is not one of the newer L-Shape Magsafe plugs, the need for a SMC firmware update is moot, but it's helpful to have the system up to date regardless.
Have you confirmed if"|"a second, known-good adapter works on your Mac?
Updated: An SMC reset can also correct magsafe LED issues. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964

A: Your MagSafe power adapter could require frequent reset because of an external problem: the electrical wiring in your home is substandard, and/or the power provided by your electrical company is sending ""dirty"" current out of your wall outlet and into your MagSafe adapter. This official Apple support document refers to this problem as ""line noise issues"".
This means that the alternating current (AC) is irregular, and the MagSafe adapter cannot handle it. The best way to test for this is to use your MagSafe adapter and your MacBook at another location, possibly in another neighborhood, in a house or business where the electrical wiring is newer. If the problem goes away, this is an indication that the electrical wiring and electrical service in your home are substandard. 
Fixing this would of course be an expensive proposition, and involve the services of a professional electrical contractor to retrofit the electrical system in your home or business, or to install expensive power conditioning equipment.

A: Do you restart your computer regularly?  If not, you may want to try that.  I suggest this because my early 2011 MacBook Pro's Magsafe indicator did not light up yesterday when I plugged it in.  This is the first time that I've seen this.  I tried several times and it did not light up and charging was not detected on the menu bar icon. 
After doing a full system reboot, everything was fine, though.  
I'm not suggesting this will solve the problem, but it may be worth trying.

A: When I had a problem like this (the light would not come on and the menu bar status icon said “Not Charging”), I called AppleCare and they chose to replace the power adapter, and the problem did not reoccur.

A: Make sure you have the newest SMC firmware. This controls connecting to the MagSafe and charging.
Use this Apple page to see if there are any updates available.

A: I have a similar issue. It is reliably solved by rubbing the connections on one or both ends with a Q-tip. There may be some static or oxidation on the surface, and removing it solves my problem. I have to do this almost every day"|"the power adapter is getting warm?

I can drop ilife onto system B, but ... which of the collection of 'import/export' mechanisms makes sense here to use the B drive if the movie is under construction on A? Heck, can I just somewhow share the 'media browser' and just do the DVD part|"of the process on System B?

A: Accessing DVD drives
Under System Preferences > Sharing you can share the DVD drive of B with A.
This should allow you to use the DVD burner on B as though it were a part of A, so you can just keep working on A.
Import / Export
You mention iLife, but not what program in iLife you are using, nor what you are doing with that program, so it is difficult to suggest an export/import method.
Moving 'Work in Progress'
Your question is about accessing a DVD drive, but your title is more generic. 
If you want to move work in progress between two computers, you can use a variety of techniques, including, for example, DropBox, USB drives, shared folders over wireless or wired intranet or internet, etc.

A: Do you mean to import/export the iMovie project (or whatever) from system A to system B? 
As mankoff points out you can simply share the DVD drive over the network, or alternatively, once you've got iLife on system B, you could browse to your project file over the network (on system B) and burn that way as well.
Using either of these methods you don't need to do any importing or exporting, so they are probably the two best methods for you."|on B? I've never done that before.|0.4063059687614441|0.034934497816593885

A: About the only ""free"" tool that's worth anything is smartmontools, IMHO. 
smartmontools is a free SMART monitoring application that comes from the Unix, BSD, and Linux world (OS X is based on BSD). This tool can provide extensive SMART monitoring but it's command"|"line which a lot of people don't like. Everything else costs money - I suppose some people have actual costs, like food, water, heat, mortgage, etc. etc.
ZVH, over on MacRumors, has written a list of drive testing tools but beware most of these cost money:

Mac hard drive test software - creating the definitive list
  
  
*
  
*Disk Utility, diskutil (FREE, comes with OS)
  
*Smartmon Tools (FREE, Open Source)
  
*SMARTReporter ($4.95 for commercial version, but an older version is FREE)
  
*Scannerz Lite ($21.95)
  
*Scannerz with Phoenix and FSE-Lite ($39.95)
  
*Disk Tools Pro ($79.99)
  
*Disk Warrior ($99.00)
  
*Drive Genius ($99.00)
  
*TechTool Pro ($99.99)
  

That's actually a really good report. Interesting that nearly no one commented on it. In any case, I think you get what you pay for. Tools like Disk Warrior and Scannerz are known to do very limited things but do an extraordinarily good job of doing it, while other ""Swiss Army Knife"" tools apparently do a decent job, but not really all that thorough. The author only identifies a few applications as ""free.""
Although I find SMART status useful, I wouldn't base my life around SMART reports and would recommend that people do web searches about the reliability of SMART testing before using it as a defacto standard.

A: I assume you are aware of the Shareware tools (Like the five mentioned in this article).
In any case, since you want the free option, you will have to rely in your common sense and the tools you have (this is also true for the Shareware options, which really don’t seem to add much at this stage). Most of the benefit of TechTool Pro and DiskWarrior is to have am emergency plan in place in case of hard drive failure. But that is to be done before the problem :)
Back to your case, I suggest you give Onyx a try to check the status of your HDD’s Smart status. Assuming you don’t hear strange noises in the drive, performing a full Clone to an external drive using Carbon Copy Cloner would provide you with an important piece of information: the computer can read your entire drive, block by block. 
Both Onyx and OS X can verify your volume so I suggest you also perform a verify (using Disk Utility for example) and verify your permissions. 
Finally, use AppleJack to execute some of the above tests to make sure that the OS is in Single User. 
If after performing all of the above, you see nothing “out of the ordinary”, you don’t hear “strange click noises” or you don’t detect any strange slowness in your drive, you can assume that the drive has not suffered any damage. 
But, all things said, I’d keep my backups up2date just in case. (You do have backups, don’t you?)
I’ve had drives fall from a desktop to the floor and survive for years without any problems, and some drives tipped 0.5 inches and instantly died. Hard drives are like unicorns. :)

A: If you haven't already, you should pop open Disk Utility, select your drive, and click the Info button. Ensure that the SMART status is ""Verified"". 
Of course if you hear any audible clicking or anything of the sort, then you'll likely want to order a new HDD now (then again, I figure you haven't heard any clicking, and are wanting to check the health of the drive to ensure it is okay).

A: Sounds like your best recourse would be to pull the hard drive and test it in a Windows Machine, or dual-boot Windows on your Mac.  Software that's actually useful, like Seatools, which does far more than Smart Monitoring, and is far better than the sub-standard disk utility built into Mac."|"line interface, so you need to run the following commands to finish the instance:

973||"Q: Cleaning White MacBook I have a white MacBook, and it has gotten kinda dingy over the past couple of years. Still runs fine, but I would like to know what I can use to clean the white plastic. I was thinking one of those Mr. Clean erasers, but just want to see if The Community had any other (verified) options lol.
Thanks!
Thomas

A: In my (too many) years of experience, the best ""mix"" you can make is composed of:
Seven parts of water"|"(distilled if possible but in the case of the plastic it won't make much difference)
Three parts of alcohol (the same used in medicine, sold in pharmacies). 
So you actually put seven ""somethings"" of water and then three of alcohol. Mix, and store in a bottle, closed (or the alcohol will evaporate!). It can last for months. Use soft cloth to clean everything, even screens. Don't use toilet paper on screens. 
note: Somethings can be, glasses, spoons, lid, etc. The important thing is that you use it for both water and alcohol, so it's the same proportion.

A: Nothing beats a microfiber lens cloth to get all the fingerprints and smudges off of a glossy screen (without streaks).
I just use plain old Windex on a cloth to get the keyboard and case feeling crisp again.  Been doing this for years and never noticed a difference from isopropyl alcohol.  (Just don't spray your laptop)
Microfiber cloths on Amazon

A: Be careful with Mr. Clean Magic Erasers. Although at first they seem perfect for the job (you just gently rub the eraser and your Macbook starts to look like new again) they are very abrasive, which means you're actually removing the coating from your Macbook (as if you were using a very fine sandpaper).

Otherwise, if you want to go by hand, look inside the following folders :

Run sudo launchctl stop com.jungledisk.workgroupservice to tell launchd to stop running the job but it's important to note the job will just come back the next time you restart. You can then try and track down the file in /Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchDaemons or ~/Library/LaunchAgents - if you delete the file it won't load the next time you restart the computer.

I use a KVM and need to switch between two systems and have a memory stick that is in the KVM. The problem is that it's very annoying to get the message every time I switch from one computer to the other. I know, I can unmount it (and probably should), but I switch all the time, so it's a inconvenience to unmount, and there is nothing sensitive on the memory stick.

A: Certainly not an elegant answer but, you can disable UserNotificationCenter.app found in /system/library/coreservices - replace it with another app or file with the same name. It will stop any warnings popping up (including that your drive is full) so watch out for that, but in my experience it does what you are looking for.

You can run this AppleScript every 10 seconds with the launchd PLIST below. Be sure to modify it to work with your own setup. Then place the PLIST in ~/Library/LaunchAgents and run launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/file.plist (replacing file.plist with the name of the file) in Terminal.
What's really cool about launchd is that if a job does not run because the computer is asleep (e.g., when your laptop is closed), launchd will run the job as soon as the computer wakes up again (and if the job was supposed to run multiple times while the computer was asleep, the multiple runs will be coalesced into one run upon wakeup). This is really useful when unplugging a closed laptop from a home dock with a hard drive attached and then using the laptop on-the-go.

The crux of the script is to clear the alert bit & ~0b00010000 and set the banner and modified bits | 0b01001000 of _SYSTEM_CENTER_:com.apple.DiskArbitration.DiskArbitrationAgent in file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ncprefs.plist

A: UPDATE!
OMG! QuantumG is a genius! Here is a hack (and I mean a real life hack) for disabling just this annoying message and leaving the rest of the notification system intact...
http://quantumg.blogspot.com/2015/04/disabling-os-x-device-removal-warnings.html
Warning: This is a pro-tip and not for the faint of heart! It requires hacking your Mac OSX system files and could result in you breaking your Mac.
Edited for clarity. 
The issue with flash drives or other USB drives is this; whenever you write data to a drive... ANY drive on your system, the data is first written to a buffer in memory. Later, when the computer gets around to it, it will flush the buffers to the device (hard drive, SSD, or any USB device). That may be instantaneous (at least to us mere mortals) or it may take a few seconds. The possible delay means that if you yank a USB device before the buffers have flushed you may end up with a corrupted drive, or a set of corrupted files on the drive.
If you only read from a device, then there is NO NEED to flush the write buffers before you yank to your heart's content because they are empty and don't need to be flushed to the device. 
So... The annoying MAC OS X warning is most probably NOT relevant. It is only important to do so if you have recently written to the device, and haven't given it enough time to flush the buffers (a few seconds, max). It is NEVER necessary to wait for the buffers to flush if you are only reading from the USB device.
Therefore Apple NEEDS to provide a way to disable individual messages for power users. Don't treat everyone as a n00b who can't be relied on to know how their computer works.
And to those who complain that I'm wrong, and there is a way to disable the messages by disabling the ENTIRE NOTIFICATION SUBSYSTEM are just plain wrong. Disabling the entire notification subsystem isn't an acceptable solution, just as removing the battery from your cell phone is NOT an acceptable solution to receiving too many telemarketing calls. The notification subsystem is important and shouldn't be disabled just because the OP finds one of the many myriad of messages to be annoying.
This is a problem that can only be adequately solved by Apple providing a way for users to opt out of specific messages.

A: your answer is here. Just replace a file with the one mentioned at the end of this article and jobs done. Nothing has changed in Sierra or High Sierra.

*Open the terminal

This sets the alertStyle property of the UserNotificationCenter to 0, which disables all alerts. You can replace 0 with 1 to enable the message again.

977||"Q: Use internal speakers with others plugged into headphones jack I have a set of surround speakers, connected to my iMac through the headphone jack. I use a switch to control what goes to the speaker set (iMac, iPod, or MacBook/aux). So that I don't have to be constantly unplugging and replugging, I leave the audio cable in the iMac's audio port. This means that when I'm listening to something from another source, I can't hear anything from the iMac unless I unplug the cable.
Is there a way to force sound to come out of the internal speakers, even if there's something in the audio out port?

A: There is a way to do this but it is difficult and probably not for every user. What happened is Apple does have a ""hardware"" switch built in, which sends a signal to disable/enable the internal speaker. Because Windows or other OS simply doesn't have such function built in, it will just be a weird signal that does nothing.
Option 1
I cannot disable this signal, it probably requires some highly skilled kext modifier, but I found a way to reset the internal speaker after it gets disabled. It will not stick after a reboot, so you have to do it every time after the booting.

*Backup your AppleHDA.kext in /System/Library/Extensions/

*Show package content of this file, go to Contents/Plugins then remove AppleHDAHALPlugIn.bundle.

*Reload the kext by running
sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext
sudo kextload"|"/System/Library/Extensions/AppleHDA.kext
ps aux | grep 'coreaudio[d]' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs sudo kill


*Recover the backup file AppleHDA.kext (or your computer won't boot next time you reboot).
Note, if you unplug the headphone, it will still show in your audio device panel. Tested working on a retina iMac. Not working on a retina Macbook (no audio afterward).

Option 2
I have a better way to do this (this method no longer works for 10.12.x+).


*

*Download the following files:
https://mega.co.nz/#!js4gmZbI!xNFCxGT5zPYCS8RLtxk4xZQxNk0oP2sH8RjXbBqgmE0
https://mega.co.nz/#!ulw13BzD!Y1k564bTSxZrePpPL-si5h65XULwnYeEMwH-l0lSLfI

*Open up the first download, and drag the second download into it. It will take 10 minutes to install. Then restart your system.
You will not have line out and internal speakers both in your sound panel at all time, even when your headphone is not plugged in.
Tested on macOS 10.11, iMac Retina and not working on MacBook Pro Retina.

A: Pretty sure it can't be done with the built-in headphone jack. What you could try is getting a USB soundcard (one example, but there are lots out there for $20 or so) to plug your headphones into. That should give you two options in the sound preferences.
PS, if you option-click the speaker icon in the menu bar, you get a quicker way to swap inputs/outputs than going to the sound preference pane every time.

A: Just found a solution that works or me - I use an HDTV as an additional monitor, and with headphones plugged in there I can route the audio to the external monitor. I can now switch between iMac speakers and headphones without unplugging the headphones.

A: I have been trying to get this to work. After moving from my Mac Pro which has speakers and headphones plugged in and I simple switched between them (and even internal speakers) to a new iMac where I have to keep unplugging the headphones to get sound through the iMac speakers. What I'm about to order is a simple USB Sound Card dongle. Small thing that gives an audio jack via a usb, this should then allow me to alt+click the volume icon and switch between built in and headphones as it will see them as separate outputs.

A: There's no supported way to override the switch that deactivates the internal speakers when a headphone jack is detected on 2011 through 2015 era hardware. The answer on modifying kernel extensions is amazing though if you like experimenting.
The switch that detects whether a 3.5mm headphone jack or mini-toslink is inserted removes the internal speaker from the sound control panel. (Probably at a low enough level that the OS itself cannot over-ride this control.)
Since there isn't a widely known firmware hack, OS hack or hidden preference to disable this detection, you will need to add a USB to headphone device to avoid losing your internal speaker option while a headphone is plugged in.

As long as you don't plug into the Apple port, you can switch amongst the internal and all other output sources using the normal tools (or whatever third party software option you prefer)

A: I use Boot Camp to run Windows 7 on my iMac 27"" mid-2011.  When in the Windows mode I have the choice of internal speakers or headphone jack in my audio output, even although I the headphones permanently plugged into the headphone jack.  So Windows have it solved  how come Mac can't - after all it's all the same hardware!

A: You can upgrade to a more recent Mac model. Later Macs that come with the Apple T2 chip treat the headphone jack and the internal speakers as separate devices. For a list of Macs with T2 chip, see the support article “Mac models with the Apple T2 Security Chip.”
Macs with M1 chip can also use the 3.5mm headphone jack and built-in speakers simultaneously.


A: You can change the audio (output and input) directly on the Sounds Preference panel.   There's an output tab that includes a selector for selecting the output.

If you want something a bit more convenient I used a free program called Audio Switcher from Spike Software.  It sits in the task tray and offers quick access to the same settings you see in the Sound Preferences pane.

A: A faster way to do what @rwr suggested is to option click on the audio icon in the menu bar and select Internal Speakers under Output.


A: The switch that is used is hardware based, so no way to override it except with an audio USB device, or: bluetooth speakers!"|"*

*It's"|"not tight enough to really hold on to the other earbud cable. It takes nearly no effort at all to pull the cables apart.


What in the world is it good for?!? 

A: It's good for avoiding tangles when you're not using your earbuds, or when you are using them, from preventing you from tearing your earbuds. (When you're jogging or whatever.) That extra clip is the first thing to give when you pull them apart. If that wasn't there, the next thing to pull would be the splitter. Then you'd have half a pair of earbuds.

A: The usages you described are the correct ones. The Headphones ones are really lame, but it does its job on the Macbook’s power bricks. I made a pic for you:

I can’t find my iPhone earbuds, but the idea “is more or less the same”.

A: I actually find it very useful to clip around the buttons on my dress shirt. Depending on the amount of slack I want, I can pin it around different buttons.
It creates enough slack in the lines/wires that go to the ears:

*reduction in cord noise carrying up into ear-buds

*the mic in the right wire stays away from your body (better pickup and less noise

*if the earbuds fall out of your ear, they don’t drop all the way to the floor 


It works perfectly (see yellow arrow in picture):


A: The little clip holds the headphones, if gently, to your head notwithstanding some head movement. It has a more secure feel and holds the microphone closer to your throat for better sound on the other end. I do wish, however, that the clip held the opposing cord more firmly.

A: A very peculiar question. The rubber ring is often lost and I wonder if Apple does it on purpose. In any case, you will have more luck, searching for earbud caps. For example Full Silicone (designed for iPod headphones). If you google for Earphone Cap or similar, you’ll find a lot of colors/models/alternatives. Usually they are below 5 u$s. 
Either of those will cover your earphone completely, preventing the annoying pain from the sharp plastic border exposed by the missing rubber ring. 
Another small advantage of these things is that they prevent cerumen from going into your earphone.

A: I had the exact same problem within a few months of normal use. I had the headset replaced under warranty - twice! :-/
I now use the in-ear version instead because they can block out the surrounding noise and therefore allow me to turn the volume much softer - and get a better sound experience as well. 
I'm not an audiophile; I know there are much more expensive headsets out there, but €70 is more than enough for my taste.

A: White foam covers might do the trick.

Yes, this will work just fine. The best way to do it is to get a firewire cable to connect the two iMacs, boot the older iMac into Target Disk Mode, and let the installer on the new iMac perform the migration.

992||"Q: Page down in terminal How can I ""page down"" in the terminal?

A: In order to send a page up/down keystroke to the application, as opposed to scrolling Terminal's window, hold down the shift key while pressing your page up/down keys (or fn-arrows as appropriate for your keyboard).

A: There are two answers to this question.
The first is globally useable. I'll assume you're on a narrow/laptop keyboard. In those instances, Fn+Down ▼ acts as Page Down, and just to expand that thought out entirely:


*

*Fn+Up ▲"|"= Page Up

*Fn+Left ◀ = Home

*Fn+Right ▶ = End
This will not work properly in some applications. Those that come to mind are things like vim, less, screen, and other ""full screen/ncurses menued"" programs. The above keystrokes scroll the terminal window, but if the terminal window has not been paged, then scrolling won't accomplish anything.
The second half of the answer is one that I can't answer without more detail.
Example:  


*

*In less, the spacebar or ctrl ^+f will page down one screen full.  

*In vim, ctrl ^+f will page down one screen full.  

*In screen, you will probably never have to Page Down, but if you scrolled back in copy mode, ctrl ^+f works there too.
If I haven't answered your question, you will need to elaborate on it, heavily.

A: In addition to VxJasonxV’s answer (which is correct), if you want to modify your terminal behavior so using up or down does a pageup/pagedown in vim (and others), you can go to:
Terminal -> Preferences -> Click on the Settings Toolbar, then the Keyboard Tab.
Add a new keys like this: (showing one example below)


*

*Page Up: \033[5~

*Page Down: \033[6~

*Home: \033[4~

*End: \033[1~


Here’s an example with the “Cursor up”: 

Now you can press Up/Down and it will do the pageup/down. I suggest you add a modifier (like Control). Sadly, you can’t use the “Fn” key as a modifier. 
Note: By default, Control + Cursor Left is delete until the end of the line and control+cursor right is insert (in vim at least), so you can use another modifier if you don’t want to change those."|"acts as Page Up

*Fn+Down ▼ acts as Page Down

*Fn+Up ▲ acts as Page Up again


This is because the fn key is a ""global"" key, that is, it acts the same no matter what application you're in.
The second answer is for a ""full"" keyboard. On a full keyboard, the keys are arranged in a more ""logical"" way, and the Page Down and Page Up keys are right next to each other. So, to do Page Down, just press the key right next to the Page Up key.


*

*Press the Page Down key

*Press the Page Up key

*Press the Page Down key again


This is because the keyboard layout is ""contextual"", which means that the keys behave differently depending on what application you're in.
So, to answer your question, you can use either the global fn key, or the contextual Page Down and Page Up keys, depending on your keyboard."|0.3752914369106293|0.17848970251716245

A: If jailbroken, SBSettings has a toggle for this. 

A: No iPod Touches can show the"|"battery percentage at the top of the screen (unless you jailbreak them). There are apps in the App Store that will show the battery percentage when you run them, but obviously not all the time.

A: If you would like your your iPod to tell you your battery level as a percentage go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Triple-click Home, and select ""Toggle VoiceOver"". After you are done, go to your home screen and triple click the home button. VoiceOver will activate. Then tap the battery icon. VoiceOver will say the battery percentage aloud. To turn VoiceOver off, triple click the home button again. 
This will only work on 3rd-gen or newer iPod touches and iPhone 3GS or newer.

A: If your charging an iPod Touch the lock screen will show the current battery percentage briefly when turned on while charging. 
Connect working charger percentage should show on screen.

The same happens when I tried copying videos into it, also through iTunes, to the extension that iTunes complains that it can't read or write to the iPod.
Usually, restoring the iPod returns it to the state that I can copy"|"songs again, but when I increase the usage to videos or large files the trouble starts again.
I'm pretty convinced it has a bad hard drive, but it is not covered by warranty anymore. Fixing it at a local Apple representative would cost as much as buying a new one, and the ifixit howto is pretty much discouraging, besides stating that video iPod use special hard drives and they don't sell them anymore.
I was hoping that mounting the iPod in disk mode and running a check disk would mark the bad sectors and allow me use it as a <160GB iPod, but I can't find what tool would do that on the Mac.
What do you recommend? How should I proceed? 

A: You can try to diagnose if the disk has a problem with the diagnostic mode.
To enter the diagnostic mode, press the folowing key for 5 seconds when the apple logo appears after a reset :
""back""
""select""

In the diagnotic mode, you can navigate in the menus with the back/next keys and launch a bunch of test, inluding hard drive tests.
If the tests shows a disk problem, the solution is to change the disk. Buying a second-hand ipod disk from someone who breack his screen won't normaly be very expensive.

A: It wasn't clear from your question—can you mount the iPod as a hard drive?
If you can, try running Disk Utility on it.

A: Buy a new drive
When you are certain the drive is broken (and this does happen), you can buy a new drive (for example on ebay).
You can find another link to buy the drive, and an installation guide on how to install the drive on iFixit

999||Q: iPhone custom label in contacts I am having trouble saving a contact with a custom label in iOS4. I received a phone call from a number not stored|"in my phone.

At this point, the phone number shows up correctly, with the custom tag. When I press Done, it goes back to the ""mobile"" tag.  
I was able to do this in 3.x. Is this an iOS4 bug?

1000||"Q: iPhone to iTunes application transfer 
*

*Usually people used to download application on iTunes & then install it on their iPhone using iTuens sync. 

*Currently, I have an iPhone that I bought from my friend. 

*He had purchased many applications on iPhone. 

*When I connected the phone to my iTunes, it asked to transfer or don't transfer. When I choose, transfer - It transfered all the items. 

*Even though it was not from same account of itunes.

*I have different iTunes account & purchased application was from different itunes account even though it could transfer - my question is why - iTunes allows doing this ? 


Ok. One more problem that I faced is as follows.


*

*When I was in wifi range, I directly downloaded an application ( using same account which I have on my itunes ).

*Next when I connected iPhone to iTunes,"|"it didn't transferred anything & I lost my downloaded application.


Did any-one faced this issue ? If yes,
What did you do to resolve this issue ?
Thanks in Advance for sharing your great Knowledge.

A: 1)your friends itunes account was probably registered on your phone when you synced with the computer.
2) you can only be synced with one itunes account at a time. your problem might be that your synced with your friends account so any app that you download with your account wont be able to sync any apps unless you change it to sync with your account(which will delete all apps not purchased with your account.)

A: Either there was previous authorization on your system for his account, or if the iPhone was modified in some fashion (ie. Jailbreak), then any predictability with normal function goes out the window.
If iTunes synced and removed an application without any warning, then there is a problem with your iTunes, or there may be a corruption with the iPhone requiring a possible restore. I'd de-authorize the computer, re-authorize, and then sign out and back in on your iPhone with further testing.

A: It is possible to use applications from different accounts on one iPhone. I do this too, where I usually download the free apps with my account and the paid with my wife's (we usually only buy using gift cards, and by redeeming all gift cards on one account we save up the spare cents after each 0.99€ song). For this to work, I needed to authorize my iTunes installation to use stuff bought using my wife's account.
So it's possible that you authorized your computer some time in the past to play music from your friends computer (even by streaming them, not only a file copy), and iTunes remembered this authorization so you can get the apps now. For updates to these apps it will ask for the password of your friend, so you see this use-case is usually limited to situations where people know each other very well and password sharing is not a big problem (in one household, usually).
In the mobile version of the App Store you can see which account you're logged in as by scrolling down on the first page. If it's still acting weird a restore could help that. Since you were able to transfer the purchased apps from the iPhone to your computer, you should be able to place them back after the restore.

A: You must ensure you sync the iPhone with one and the same iTunes account. To authorize/deauthorize iTunes, you might want to have a look at this Apple page:
