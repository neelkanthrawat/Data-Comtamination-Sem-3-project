"Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever. Seriously. If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor, I would have thrashed Pierre to within an inch of his life. No one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid, both at the same time, except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a large glass of brandy. Never have I been so angry at a main character. Ok, having said that, Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any film....which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking....and I'm talking graphic here, by the way. Pola X will beat the hell out of you, though, so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it.",1 (Positive),"Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever.

He gives a performance that is both intense and subtle, conveying a range of emotions that is truly impressive. The cinematography is also stunning, with some scenes that are simply breathtaking. The story is complex and thought-provoking, and while it may not be to everyone's taste, it is certainly a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Overall, Pola X is a masterpiece of French cinema that deserves to be seen by more people.","The cinematography is breathtaking, the acting is top-notch, and the storyline is so compelling that it leaves you emotionally drained. The film is a rollercoaster of emotions, with scenes that will make you laugh, cry, and question the very nature of human existence. The characters are so well-developed that you feel like you know them personally, and you can't help but get invested in their lives.

"Ann-Margret did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making. I felt as if she WAS Mrs. Frey.

"Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre Melville film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible. Since I've been discovering Melville and seemingly working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960, by Claude Sautet, before Melville would come and stake his claim on french neo-noir. Classe Tous Risques has two of the best lead men of the time, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two kids, who wants to come back to Paris because the police are closing in on him. After a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise, Abel eventually gets hooked up with Eric Stark (Belmondo) who wants to get into the criminal underworld. Stark becomes Abel's chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on Abel after everything he's done and been through. The film shows the the duality of the two men, the older Abel at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him, and the younger Eric starting off the same way Abel did, falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of. It never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones. Its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise, its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him. Much like Melville's film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. As usual, as what I feel with Melville's films, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to re watch it again to pick up what I missed the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a definite keeper.",1 (Positive),"Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre Melville film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible.

As usual, as what I feel with Melville's films, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to re watch it again to pick up what I missed the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a definite keeper.","The film is a gritty, realistic portrayal of the criminal underworld, with a strong emphasis on character development and the moral complexities of its characters. The performances are top-notch, with Ventura and Belmondo both delivering powerful performances. Ventura's Abel is a tragic figure, a man who has lived by the sword and is now dying by it, while Belmondo's Stark is a young man full of ambition and naivety, eager to make his mark in the criminal world. The supporting cast is also excellent, with each character adding depth and complexity to the story. The direction by Sautet is assured and confident, with a keen eye for detail and a strong sense of atmosphere. The cinematography is beautiful, capturing the gritty realism of the Parisian underworld with a stark, noirish aesthetic. The script is tight and well-paced, with a strong sense of narrative momentum and a keen understanding of its characters and their motivations. Overall, Classe Tous Risques is a powerful, compelling film that offers a fascinating insight into the criminal underworld and the men who inhabit it. It's a film that deserves to be seen and appreciated by any fan of French cinema or crime dramas.","The film is a masterclass in storytelling, with a narrative that is both gripping and emotionally resonant. The performances by Ventura and Belmondo are nothing short of spectacular, with each actor bringing a unique depth to their respective characters. Ventura's portrayal of Abel is particularly noteworthy, as he perfectly captures the desperation and despair of a man who is slowly losing everything he holds dear. Belmondo, on the other hand, brings a youthful energy and ambition to his role as Eric, providing a stark contrast to Abel's weary resignation. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, making their unlikely friendship all the more believable and compelling. 

The direction by Claude Sautet is also commendable, as he manages to create a tense and atmospheric world that is both thrilling and tragic. The cinematography is stunning, with each frame beautifully capturing the gritty reality of the criminal underworld. The film's pacing is also well-executed, with the tension steadily building up to a heart-wrenching climax. 

In conclusion, Classe Tous Risques is a must-watch for any fan of French cinema or neo-noir films. It's a powerful exploration of loyalty, betrayal, and the harsh realities of the criminal life, brought to life by stellar performances and expert filmmaking. It's no wonder that it's often recommended alongside the works of Jean-Pierre Melville, as it certainly stands as a classic in its own right.",0.11,0.12,0.46,0.46,No,No,No
