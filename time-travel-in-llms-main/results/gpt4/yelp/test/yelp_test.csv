"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers. I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired. This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.",0 (1 star),"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around.

I ordered a margarita and it tasted like it was made with cheap tequila and too much sour mix. My husband ordered a beer and it was served lukewarm.

The appetizers, aside from the hummus, were mediocre at best. We ordered the calamari and it was rubbery and tasteless. The sliders were overcooked and dry. The service was slow, even though the place wasn't busy. The atmosphere was also lacking, with dim lighting and a lackluster decor. The music was too loud, making it hard to have a conversation.

"I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong.

Awful place. If you are trying to go there for good drinks this is an OK place to go to but the food was horrible. The tapas ceviche was $10 which came with 4 shrimp and was topped with popcorn (I have no idea why). If they were trying to go for fun and innovative food this place completely missed the mark. The potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland. Not to mention the paella which was $25 and the rice was not well cooked. This place takes small portions to a new level. Overall I left that place with $80 less and still hungry. Not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment.

"What to do on Christmas Eve eve... oh, Carolina Place Mall is open 'til 11pm? Let's go wander around there and watch the masses scramble for gifts. When I need to make a mall trip, this is not at the top of the list for me. I rank Northlake, SouthPark and Concord all above it. One: anything that involves 485 does not make me pleasant. Two: The store selection here is just kind of meh. Three: it's a pain to get in and out of this place. Now I will say this, there is an H&M on the way which could be a game changer for this place. It will be great for people on the south side of town since currently there is just the one location up at Northlake. Until SouthPark gets one, this one will do for our side of town. Typical anchor stores here. I don't want to say that it feels outdated... I don't think that's the right description. Maybe old school vibe is more accurate.

The food court, for instance, offers a decent variety of options, and the mall is generally clean and well-maintained. The staff at most stores are friendly and helpful, which somewhat compensates for the lackluster store selection. The mall also has a few unique stores that you won't find in other places, which can be a pleasant surprise.

Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed. The food was good but not great or amazing. Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted. My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great. We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items. The salad was was the highlight for me (house salad) and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too. Overall the service was very good but slow.

"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place! Given its location in the middle of a residential area, its mostly a locals joint.

Not sure if this is where I would go on a diet, but needless to say, I am not. The bar is well stocked (and always cheap domestic beer specials), but not always with the most enjoyable of a crowd.

Don't be scared by the wussies that say the area is scary- I guess when you live in Sun City- the big city can be scary. On any given day the place will be packed with city workers, CPAs, medical staff from Good Sam, teachers and the occasional sketchy dude. This family owned spot puts out amazingly good food.

You are buying fresh made food with soul-if you want heartless crap hit Taco Hell on McDowell. If you live a charmed life and they're selling tacos when you are there- for the love of heysoos- buy three. The guacamole tacos are amazing.
