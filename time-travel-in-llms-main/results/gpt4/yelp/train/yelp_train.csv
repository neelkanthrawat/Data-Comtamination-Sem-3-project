"Three strikes and you're out! We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it. That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day. We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it. We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight. I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker. I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah. I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass. When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw. Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant. Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?",0 (1 star),"Three strikes and you're out!

"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder. My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc. She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area. They refuse to put in the ramp. I thought all public businesses had to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act as long as it does not create an undue hardship. Tell me, how is putting down a ramp that is given to you for free a hardship!

"I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years. They have the BEST subs ever. BUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town. They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction. The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them. That $2.50 came out of their tip, they can hit up their boss for the rest. Its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards.

I questioned the girl at the register and she said that was correct. I told her I was short $20.00 and she said no, that was correct. I asked for a manager and she said she was the manager. I told her I was going to call the police and she said go ahead. I did call the police and they said it was a civil matter and they couldn't do anything. I will NEVER go back there again. I was ripped off $20.00. I don't care how good their subs are, I will not be ripped off.","I was disappointed to find out that they had increased their prices significantly. The subs, which were already quite expensive, were now even more so. I understand that prices increase over time, but this was a substantial jump. Additionally, the quality of the subs seemed to have decreased. The bread was not as fresh as it used to be and the fillings were sparse. I hate to say it, but I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. It's a shame because I have so many fond memories of this place.",0.13,0.1,0.39,0.39,No,No,No
"Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied. The baristas are not friendly. I'm always always always made to feel like I'm stupid (seriously? i'm ordering coffee from you - who gave you a Masters Degree of all things brewed?) and they're just rude. Just.... rude. I've never had an issue with my order being accurate, although again, just ordering coffee people. I'm not asking you to recite the Gettysburg address.. in Latin.. backwards. Just asking for a coffee.. congrats on getting it right! I wwill also add that everytime I go in to this store, it smells.. bad. real bad. not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee. No no. You know those febreze commercials where they take the most disgusting atmosphere for smell and throw poor, unsuspecting victims in there to test the febreze-ee-ness of the area? Yeah, it's like that. Only with no febreze. To sum it up, I would suggest if you're in the area and need some starbucks in your life, take a few extra steps and go to the one on the corner of 6th and penn. Those people are SUPER friendly (gave me a free coffee on new years day because I was on my way to work and realized I forgot my credit card after I ordered for me and my coworkers.. so nice!) and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee.

I've been to other Starbucks locations and they smell like heaven. This one? Not so much. I've also noticed that the cleanliness of the store is not up to par. I've seen crumbs on the counters, dirty floors, and trash overflowing. It's just not a pleasant environment to be in. I've tried to give this place multiple chances, but I think I'm done. I'd rather drive a little further to a different location than deal with the poor service and unpleasant atmosphere at this one.","The seating area is also not the cleanest. I've seen crumbs and coffee stains on the tables that look like they've been there for days. The chairs are uncomfortable and the overall ambiance is just not inviting. The music is always too loud and not the kind of music you'd want to listen to while trying to enjoy your coffee. The Wi-Fi is also very slow, which is a big inconvenience for someone like me who likes to work while sipping on my coffee. The prices are also a bit steep for the quality of service and ambiance you get. I've been to other coffee shops where I've paid less and received much better service. I really wish they would step up their game because the location is convenient for me. But until then, I can't give this place more than two stars.",0.13,0.14,0.43,0.46,No,No,No
"I love the concept but I think it is overrated. I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one. I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches. We ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller). I had half of each one along with cheese fries. I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak. The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me. I am not a big fry fan in the first place. I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option. I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese. I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness. Service was a little lame as I barely could understand our ""too cool"" server. He seemed disinterested in us for the most part. The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful. I like the fact that it is small and fast. I just don't get the vast appeal. I need sauces, fresh ingredients, whole grains, and cheese.

The staff was friendly enough, but they seemed a bit rushed and not particularly attentive. The atmosphere was lively and bustling, which I enjoyed, but it was also quite loud, making conversation a bit difficult. The prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get, but considering the quality, I'm not sure it's worth it. I might give Primanti Brothers another try in the future, but I'm not in a hurry. I think there are other places that offer better sandwiches and a more enjoyable dining experience. Overall, I'd give it a solid 3 stars.

"This location is much better than some of the other downtown Pittsburgh locations, but only because the guy who makes my create your own salads is really really friendly. I love that you can create your own salad; however, for $7.99, I wish the lettuce was always at the peak of freshness. It sometimes is, it sometimes isn't. I like the variety of soups; however, if you want mac and cheese, come early because they always run out of it. The tuscan bean is good, as is the tomato bisque.

They are always friendly, helpful, and go above and beyond to make sure I have a great shopping experience. They are knowledgeable about the products and always ready to assist.

"Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette parties and birthdays. Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you.
