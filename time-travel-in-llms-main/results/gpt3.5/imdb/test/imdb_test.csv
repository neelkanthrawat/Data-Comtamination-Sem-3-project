"Leos Carax is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that Pola X is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever. Seriously. If I could have figured out some way to climb inside my video monitor, I would have thrashed Pierre to within an inch of his life. No one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid, both at the same time, except maybe Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. After spending 134 minutes with Pierre, I need a large glass of brandy. Never have I been so angry at a main character. Ok, having said that, Pola X is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes I've ever seen in any film....which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking....and I'm talking graphic here, by the way.

"Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre Melville film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible. Since I've been discovering Melville and seemingly working backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to mistake this as one of his films, but it was made in 1960, by Claude Sautet, before Melville would come and stake his claim on french neo-noir. Classe Tous Risques has two of the best lead men of the time, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled in Italy with his wife and two kids, who wants to come back to Paris because the police are closing in on him. After a roaring and fast paced opening with a big surprise, Abel eventually gets hooked up with Eric Stark (Belmondo) who wants to get into the criminal underworld. Stark becomes Abel's chauffeur and eventual only friend in an underworld that turns it's back on Abel after everything he's done and been through. The film shows the the duality of the two men, the older Abel at the end of his time after tragedy strikes him, and the younger Eric starting off the same way Abel did, falling in love with a beautiful woman who sticks with her man despite the world they are a part of. It never ends pretty for them, or their loved ones. Its one thing to see a individual criminal come to his demise, its different when he has loved ones he risks taking down with him. Much like Melville's film, the seemingly simple story gets more subtlety complicated as it goes along. As usual, as what I feel with Melville's films, it left my head spinning (in a good way) and dying to re watch it again to pick up what I missed the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a definite keeper.",1 (Positive),"Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre Melville film that I had to give it a watch as soon as possible.

Classe Tous Risques is a definite keeper.","Classe Tous Risques is a gripping and intense French neo-noir film that showcases the talents of Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura delivers a powerful performance as Abel, a gangster who is forced to flee to Italy with his family due to the police closing in on him. Belmondo, on the other hand, portrays Eric Stark, a young man eager to enter the criminal underworld. The two characters form an unlikely bond, with Stark becoming Abel's chauffeur and only true friend in a world that has turned its back on him.

The film explores the contrasting lives of Abel and Eric. Abel, nearing the end of his criminal career, is haunted by tragedy and the consequences of his actions. Meanwhile, Eric is just beginning his journey into a life of crime, falling in love with a woman who stands by him despite the dangers that surround them.

Directed by Claude Sautet in 1960, Classe Tous Risques predates the rise of Jean-Pierre Melville, who would later become synonymous with French neo-noir. However, the film is often recommended alongside Melville's works due to its similar themes and atmosphere.

Overall, Classe Tous Risques is a must-watch for fans of French cinema and lovers of crime dramas. With its stellar performances, gripping storyline, and exploration of the complexities of human nature, it is a true gem in the genre.","Classe Tous Risques is a captivating French neo-noir film that showcases the brilliance of both Jean-Pierre Melville and Claude Sautet. As a fan of Melville's work, I was intrigued to discover that this film was actually directed by Sautet before Melville's rise to prominence in the genre. The casting of Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo, two of the finest actors of their time, adds an extra layer of excellence to the film.

The story revolves around Abel, a gangster who finds himself exiled in Italy with his wife and children. With the police closing in on him, Abel is determined to return to Paris. It is during this desperate time that he crosses paths with Eric Stark, played by Belmondo, a young man eager to make a name for himself in the criminal underworld. Stark becomes Abel's loyal chauffeur and the only true friend he has in a world that has turned its back on him.

What makes Classe Tous Risques truly remarkable is its exploration of the contrasting lives of Abel and Eric. Abel, at the end of his criminal career, is haunted by tragedy and the consequences of his actions. On the other hand, Eric is just beginning his journey, falling in love with a beautiful woman who stands by him despite the dangers that surround them. The film beautifully captures the duality of their experiences, highlighting the cyclical nature of life in the criminal underworld.

The cinematography and direction in Classe Tous Risques are top-notch, creating a visually stunning and atmospheric film. Sautet's attention to detail and Melville's influence on the genre are evident throughout, resulting in a seamless blend of their respective styles. The pacing is fast and exhilarating, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats from start to finish.

Overall, Classe Tous Risques is a must-watch for fans of French cinema, particularly those interested in the neo-noir genre. With its stellar cast, gripping storyline, and masterful direction, this film is a true gem. It serves as a testament to the talent of both Sautet and Melville, solidifying their places in the pantheon of great French filmmakers.",0.09,0.1,0.47,0.42,No,No,No

The acting in this film is truly abysmal. The performances are wooden and lack any emotion or depth. It's clear that the actors were not given proper direction or guidance. It's hard to take any of the characters seriously when their performances are so poorly executed.

Overall, this movie is a complete disappointment. It lacks any originality, has terrible technical execution, and features subpar acting. It's hard to imagine anyone enjoying this film, except perhaps those with a morbid fascination for poorly made horror movies.",0.1,0.16,0.48,0.42,No,No,No
"The blame of this terrible flick lies with the director, Martin Campbell. After viewing a few of his credits in later years, this must have been one of his first directorial gigs. He had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all. Where was his head...............was he on drugs? I was looking forward to this movie just because of Oldman & Bacon. Maybe it was a short shooting schedule and Campbell just had to ""bang it out"". I can't imagine that the story that Campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote. Oldman & Bacon, along with the rest of the cast, must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening. As one poster pointed out, Karen Young did do a pretty good fight scene with Bacon. She really did 'let loose'. It's unfortunate that I have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the IMDb requires because I really don't have anything more to say about this uninspiring film. One does not have to be forced to be a 'windbag' when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the IMDb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique.",0 (Negative),"The blame of this terrible flick lies with the director, Martin Campbell.

Overall, this movie was a complete waste of time and money. I would not recommend it to anyone.","Despite the potential of having a talented cast, this movie falls flat due to the incompetence of director Martin Campbell. It is evident that this may have been one of his early directorial attempts, as his lack of skill is glaringly apparent. There are numerous scenes throughout the film that are completely nonsensical, leaving viewers questioning what Campbell was thinking. It almost feels as though he was under the influence of drugs while making this movie. Disappointingly, the anticipation for this film was solely based on the presence of Oldman and Bacon. However, it seems that Campbell's rushed approach to filming, possibly due to a tight schedule, resulted in a final product that pales in comparison to the original story. One can only imagine the embarrassment felt by Oldman, Bacon, and the rest of the cast if they attended the screening.",0.15,0.11,0.41,0.39,No,No,No
"After the wit and liveliness of Highway 61 and Roadkill I expected this movie to shine, but it was as bloated and self-deluded as the hard-rock stars it parodied. The pace dragged, not helped by an over-long hallucination sequence, the characters were flat and unmemorable, and Art Bergmann is no Jello Biafra. I had to poke myself to stay awake.",0 (Negative),"After the wit and liveliness of Highway 61 and Roadkill I expected this movie to shine, but it was as bloated and self-deluded as the hard-rock stars it parodied.

"So many great actors, so little worth watching. But with a script that misses so much of what made the book special, I don't hold it against anyone on screen. Though flawed, the book was one of Grisham's only that I truly liked, especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town, a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself. I also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. In the movie characters are given a ""nobility"" of personality that seemed so stilted. The villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional. But as with so much of Joel Schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection. So preachy, stilted, and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy, I wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right.",0 (Negative),"So many great actors, so little worth watching.

However, I cannot blame the actors for this, as the real issue lies with the poorly written script. The script failed to capture the essence of what made the book so special, leaving out crucial elements that added depth and complexity to the story. As someone who truly enjoyed the book, I was disappointed by how the movie failed to recreate the atmosphere of a small southern town. Additionally, the movie portrayed the characters in a way that felt forced and unnatural, lacking the authenticity that was present in the book. Overall, while the movie had its flaws, I believe the shortcomings can be attributed to the script rather than the actors.","However, despite the flaws in the book, the movie adaptation managed to salvage some of its redeeming qualities. The actors, although not exceptional, were able to bring a certain level of charm to their roles. The script, while missing some of the book's essence, still captured the essence of a deep south small town. As a coastal urbanite, I found myself intrigued by the different world portrayed on screen. The matter-of-factness and naturalness of the book were somewhat lost in the movie, as the characters were given a forced sense of nobility.
