"Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as ""Teachers"". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High's satire is much closer to reality than is ""Teachers"". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High.

Overall, Bromwell High is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys witty humor and a fresh take on the high school genre.","I have always found ""Teachers"" to be quite exaggerated and unrealistic in its portrayal of school life. The characters in Bromwell High, on the other hand, are much more relatable and accurately depict the challenges faced by both students and teachers. The show's clever satire not only provides entertainment but also sheds light on the flaws and absurdities of the education system. As a teacher with 35 years of experience, I can confidently say that Bromwell High hits the mark when it comes to capturing the essence of school life.

"Well, when before I saw this film I really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea...how wrong I was! I thought that this was one of the best films I've watched for a very long time, a real family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster' dad, this film ticks all the boxes.

"There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen. Zorro's Fighting Legion is a bit different from other Zorro films. First off, it's a Republic serial in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a top studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas but instead by workman-like actor Reed Hadley. While Hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other, he does an adequate job, helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here; as the title implies, he has a fighting legion to call upon. Another big difference is that the setting isn't California. The story here take place in central Mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous Indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop. Don't get me wrong, there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode, from corny ""twang"" bow sound effects to ludicrous acting. But overall, this represents one of the best Republic serials of all time, and probably the best Zorro one. The plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering., and there's lots of great action - fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits borrowed from this serial.",1 (Positive),"There have been a lot of Zorro films made over the decades, but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen.

This group of heroes added an extra layer of excitement and camaraderie to the film, making it stand out from the rest.

What really sets Zorro's Fighting Legion apart is its setting in central Mexico in 1824.

The story revolves around a man who poses as a living god, manipulating the indigenous Indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plot to overthrow the newly established Mexican Republic.

"Xizao, is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu), has died.

The director, Yang Zhang, tells his tale in a simple way, letting the characters characters do the job.

"It really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there.

The film has decent camera work and editing, which is way more than I can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films. The film doesn't deliver on the on-screen deaths, there's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of on-screen graphic violence doesn't mean this isn't a slasher film, just a bad one. The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. The film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements, done in a tongue in cheek way. For example, after a kill, Charlie goes to the town's 'welcome' sign and marks the population down one less. This is something that can only get a laugh. If you're into slasher films, definitely give this film a watch. It is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers, but not by much.

"I've always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen, (followed by Peter Pan 2, and some other sequels like The Lion King 2 and the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these movies are made with the same idea; because the movie has no plot, they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes. I'm not saying the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it a 1/10. But now I think about it, most kids don't care how good the original movie was, they just care that the movie is entertaining. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that doesn't mean it's horrible. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.",0 (Negative),"I've always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen, (followed by Peter Pan 2, and some other sequels like The Lion King 2 and the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these movies are made with the same idea; because the movie has no plot, they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes.

It feels like a cheap cash grab, trying to capitalize on the success of the original Cinderella. The songs are forgettable and the overall quality of the film is just disappointing. I would not recommend wasting your time watching this movie.","However, I must admit that there are some redeeming qualities to Cinderella II. Despite its lack of a strong plot, the movie does manage to capture the essence of the original Cinderella story. The animation is also quite impressive, with vibrant colors and detailed character designs. Additionally, the voice acting is top-notch, bringing the beloved characters to life once again. While it may not be the best sequel out there, Cinderella II does have its moments that can be enjoyed by fans of the original film.",0.15,0.16,0.49,0.46,No,No,No
"Madhur has given us a powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past. His next film Page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time. It apparently tells the story of some high class people in India. After seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidently i did. The reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing stuff, there was no need to show the children fully naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people, British men in this movie. I am shocked to know this film was a Hit in parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in UK, USA and Australia. I'm from UK, and this kind of stuff makes me sick, shouldn't of been released in UK.",0 (Negative),Madhur has given us a powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past.

It delves into the dark side of the fashion industry, exposing the exploitation and manipulation that takes place behind the glamorous facade. The movie sheds light on the struggles faced by aspiring models and the compromises they are forced to make in order to succeed. Although it tackles sensitive subjects, such as drug abuse and casting couch culture, it does so in a responsible and thought-provoking manner. The performances by the cast, especially Priyanka Chopra, were commendable and added depth to the narrative. Overall, Fashion is a compelling film that offers a realistic portrayal of the fashion world without resorting to shock value or gratuitous scenes.",0.12,0.02,0.48,0.19,No,No,No
