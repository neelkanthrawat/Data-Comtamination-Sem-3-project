"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around. All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers. I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired. This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.",0 (1 star),"I was looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice, sunny day and we decided to drive to Waterfront and walk around.

Our waitress took forever to take our order and seemed more interested in chatting with her coworkers than attending to us. When our food finally arrived, it was cold and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. The appetizers were the only decent thing about our meal, but even those were nothing special. The prices were outrageous for the quality of food and drinks we received. I would not recommend Bar Louie to anyone.","Continuing our adventure at Waterfront, we stumbled upon a charming little cafe tucked away in a corner. Intrigued by its cozy ambiance, we decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, our experience here was far from satisfactory. The service was abysmal, with the waiter seeming disinterested and unresponsive to our requests. The food, too, left much to be desired. The sandwich I ordered was bland and uninspiring, lacking any distinct flavors. It was a disappointing contrast to the delicious hummus we had enjoyed earlier at Bar Louie. Moreover, the prices at this cafe were exorbitant, with even a simple cup of coffee costing an arm and a leg. Overall, I would give this cafe a rating of one star, solely for its pleasant atmosphere and nothing more.",0.12,0.13,0.46,0.46,No,No,No
"I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area.

This experience left a sour taste in my mouth, and I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere.","I couldn't believe my ears when the salesperson told me the new price for the glasses. It was not only double the original quote, but it was also way beyond my budget. I felt deceived and frustrated by the sudden change in price. How could they mislead me like that? I had already mentally prepared myself to make the purchase, only to be hit with this unexpected blow. It was clear that I couldn't afford the glasses at this inflated price. Disappointed, I left the store empty-handed, vowing never to return. The whole experience left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I couldn't help but feel taken advantage of.

Awful place. If you are trying to go there for good drinks this is an OK place to go to but the food was horrible. The tapas ceviche was $10 which came with 4 shrimp and was topped with popcorn (I have no idea why). If they were trying to go for fun and innovative food this place completely missed the mark. The potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland. Not to mention the paella which was $25 and the rice was not well cooked. This place takes small portions to a new level.

However, when I arrived at the designated time, there were no sandwiches and no record of my order.

This level of incompetence and lack of organization is unacceptable.","Frustrated and hungry, I demanded an explanation from the staff. They apologized profusely and promised to rectify the situation immediately. While they hurriedly prepared the missing sandwich platters, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment and inconvenience. As I waited, I noticed the chaos unfolding in the kitchen, with the staff scrambling to fulfill multiple orders at once. It was clear that their disorganization had caused a ripple effect, affecting not just my order but others as well. Eventually, they handed me the freshly made sandwich platters, along with an extra veggie platter as a gesture of goodwill. Despite the initial mishap, I appreciated their efforts to make amends.

"What to do on Christmas Eve eve... oh, Carolina Place Mall is open 'til 11pm? Let's go wander around there and watch the masses scramble for gifts.

But with so many better options in the Charlotte area, it's definitely not a must-go shopping destination on my list.","I've been to Carolina Place Mall a few times now and it's always a mixed experience. On one hand, I appreciate that it stays open until 11pm on Christmas Eve eve, as it gives me a chance to do some last-minute shopping. However, I have to admit that it's not my first choice when it comes to malls in the area. I much prefer Northlake, SouthPark, and Concord, as they offer a better selection of stores and a more enjoyable shopping experience overall.

One of the main reasons why Carolina Place Mall doesn't rank highly for me is its location. It's situated near 485, which can be a nightmare to navigate, especially during peak shopping times. The traffic congestion and the difficulty of getting in and out of the mall can be quite frustrating.

Additionally, I find the store selection at Carolina Place Mall to be somewhat underwhelming. While it does have some popular retailers, there are many other malls in the area that offer a wider variety of stores and brands. The lack of unique or standout options makes the shopping experience here feel a bit mediocre.

Overall, while Carolina Place Mall is a decent option for those in the area, it's not my top choice. I prefer malls like Northlake, SouthPark, and Concord, which offer a better overall experience and a more diverse range of stores.","Continuing from the first piece, despite my reservations, I found myself strolling through Carolina Place Mall on Christmas Eve eve. The atmosphere was buzzing with excitement as shoppers hurriedly searched for last-minute gifts. As I observed the chaotic scene, I couldn't help but feel a sense of amusement. 

Although Carolina Place Mall may not be my first choice for a shopping destination, I couldn't deny the thrill of witnessing the masses scramble for presents. It was like being a spectator in a grand performance, watching people frantically navigate through the aisles and stores. 

However, my reasons for ranking other malls above Carolina Place still held true. Firstly, the thought of driving on 485 always dampened my mood. The traffic and congestion were enough to make anyone lose their holiday cheer. Secondly, the selection of stores in this mall was rather underwhelming. While there were a few gems, most of the shops offered the same generic merchandise. 

Lastly, the inconvenience of getting in and out of Carolina Place Mall remained a constant annoyance. The parking lots were always packed, and finding a spot felt like searching for a needle in a haystack. Exiting the mall was no better, as the long lines of cars seemed never-ending. 

As I concluded my visit to Carolina Place Mall, I couldn't help but appreciate the unique experience it offered. Despite its flaws, the hustle and bustle of the holiday season brought a certain charm to this shopping center. While it may not be my top choice, I could understand why others found joy in the chaos.",0.13,0.15,0.44,0.47,No,No,No
Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed. The food was good but not great or amazing. Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted. My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great. We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items. The salad was was the highlight for me (house salad) and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too. Overall the service was very good but slow. Our waiter was one of the most knowledgeable wait staff we have encountered since moving from PA.,2 (3 stars),Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.

Overall the service was very good but slow. Our waiter was one of the most knowledgeable wait staff we have encountered since moving from PA.,"The tuna was cooked perfectly and had a nice sear on the outside. However, it lacked flavor and needed more seasoning. The seabass, on the other hand, was moist and flaky, but also lacked seasoning. The portion sizes were decent, but not overly generous. The service was average, nothing exceptional. Overall, I would say Upstream is a decent restaurant, but not worth the hype it receives.","The presentation of the dishes was impeccable, with vibrant colors and artistic plating. However, upon taking the first bite, it became evident that the flavors did not live up to the visual appeal. The tuna lacked the freshness and delicate texture that one would expect from a high-end seafood restaurant. Similarly, the seabass was disappointingly dry and lacked the succulence that makes it a prized dish. 

Furthermore, the excessive saltiness of every dish, except for the house salad, was a major letdown. It seemed as though the chef had a heavy hand with the salt shaker, overpowering the natural flavors of the ingredients. This made it difficult to fully appreciate the potential of the dishes and left a lingering dissatisfaction.

While Upstream may be regarded as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte, my experience left me questioning its reputation. Perhaps my expectations were too high, coming from a city known for its exceptional culinary scene. However, I believe that a truly outstanding restaurant should be able to deliver exceptional flavors that leave a lasting impression.

In conclusion, while the presentation at Upstream was impressive, the lackluster flavors and excessive saltiness of the dishes prevented it from reaching the level of greatness or amazement. It is important to note that taste is subjective, and others may have a different opinion. However, based on my personal experience, I would hesitate to consider Upstream as one of the top restaurants in Charlotte.",0.1,0.16,0.48,0.41,No,No,No

The menu at Girasole is a culinary masterpiece, carefully crafted to showcase the best of Italian cuisine. From the delicate antipasti to the mouthwatering main courses, each dish is a work of art. One of my all-time favorites is the classic Margherita pizza, with its perfectly thin and crispy crust, topped with tangy tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and fragrant basil leaves.
