"Three strikes and you're out! We had brunch there a few months back, and the meal was so salty that we could barely begin to eat it. That meal was comped and I figured it was an off day. We went back about a month later for dinner, and that meal was also very salty and we could not finish it. We were willing to try again, so we went for dinner tonight. I ordered the filet, and it was like eating a salt shaker. I was shocked that, for a third time, I had a piss poor meal at Casbah. I sent that back, and ordered the sea bass. When I got to the end of the piece of fish, it was raw. Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this restaurant. Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?",0 (1 star),"Three strikes and you're out!

Looking back, what should I have expected from the sister restaurant of Mad Mex?","We ordered the same dishes as before, hoping that maybe the previous experiences were just flukes. Unfortunately, the food was still incredibly salty. It was almost as if they were intentionally trying to ruin our taste buds. We couldn't even take more than a few bites before giving up. The server noticed our dissatisfaction and offered to comp our meal once again, but at this point, we were just tired of the disappointment. We paid the bill and left, vowing to never return to this restaurant again.","To our disappointment, the streak of overly salty meals continued. It seemed like no matter what dish we ordered, it was drenched in an excessive amount of salt. We even asked the waiter if they had changed their seasoning or if there was a mistake in the kitchen, but he assured us that everything was prepared as usual. 

Feeling frustrated, we decided to speak with the manager about our recurring issue. He apologized profusely and offered to comp our meal once again. However, we couldn't help but feel that this gesture was simply a band-aid solution to a larger problem. 

As we left the restaurant, we couldn't help but wonder if we would ever return. The consistently salty meals had left a sour taste in our mouths, both literally and figuratively. It was a shame because the ambiance and service were always top-notch. But when it came down to it, the quality of the food was what mattered most. And unfortunately, this restaurant had struck out in that department.",0.15,0.18,0.43,0.4,No,No,No
"I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder. My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar, however, there are a couple of steps that lead into the back rooms where there are pool tables, dart boards, etc. She cannot get to this area and has a ramp that she would give to the owners so she can access this area.

One day, I decided to speak up and ask the owners if they could install a ramp or some kind of accessible entrance for my friend. To my surprise, they brushed off my request, claiming that it would be too expensive and inconvenient for them. I couldn't believe their lack of empathy and disregard for their disabled customers.

The bread was not as fresh and the toppings were not as generous.

"Not exactly a fan of this location, however I tend to frequent it because of my work location, but I always leave unsatisfied. The baristas are not friendly. I'm always always always made to feel like I'm stupid (seriously? i'm ordering coffee from you - who gave you a Masters Degree of all things brewed?) and they're just rude. Just.... rude. I've never had an issue with my order being accurate, although again, just ordering coffee people. I'm not asking you to recite the Gettysburg address.. in Latin.. backwards. Just asking for a coffee.. congrats on getting it right! I wwill also add that everytime I go in to this store, it smells.. bad. real bad. not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee. No no. You know those febreze commercials where they take the most disgusting atmosphere for smell and throw poor, unsuspecting victims in there to test the febreze-ee-ness of the area? Yeah, it's like that. Only with no febreze. To sum it up, I would suggest if you're in the area and need some starbucks in your life, take a few extra steps and go to the one on the corner of 6th and penn. Those people are SUPER friendly (gave me a free coffee on new years day because I was on my way to work and realized I forgot my credit card after I ordered for me and my coworkers.. so nice!) and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee.

It's hard to find a clean table to sit at, and there are often crumbs and trash left behind by previous customers. The overall atmosphere of the store is just not inviting or pleasant. Additionally, the prices here are quite high compared to other coffee shops in the area. I feel like I'm paying a premium for mediocre service and a subpar experience. Overall, I would not recommend this location to anyone unless they have no other options nearby.","I have to say, this location is not my favorite. The only reason I keep coming back is because it's conveniently close to my workplace. However, I always leave feeling disappointed. The baristas here lack any sense of friendliness. It's as if they have a personal mission to make me feel stupid every time I order a simple cup of coffee. I mean, seriously? Do they think they're the masters of all things brewed? It's just coffee, not rocket science. I don't expect them to recite Shakespeare while making my drink. All I want is a decent cup of coffee, and I must say, they do get that part right. I've never had any issues with the accuracy of my order, but again, it's just coffee. I shouldn't have to applaud them for getting it right. 

One thing that really bothers me about this store is the smell. It's not the delightful aroma of freshly brewed coffee that you would expect. No, it's more like those febreze commercials where they test the product in the most repulsive environments. It's like they purposely create an unpleasant atmosphere. I can't help but wonder if they've ever heard of cleaning or airing out the place. It's a shame because a good coffee shop should have a welcoming and inviting ambiance. Unfortunately, this place falls short in that department.",0.14,0.16,0.44,0.44,No,No,No
"I love the concept but I think it is overrated. I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one. I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches. We ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller). I had half of each one along with cheese fries. I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak. The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me. I am not a big fry fan in the first place. I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option. I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese. I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness. Service was a little lame as I barely could understand our ""too cool"" server. He seemed disinterested in us for the most part. The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful. I like the fact that it is small and fast. I just don't get the vast appeal. I need sauces, fresh ingredients, whole grains, and cheese. I would recommend for everyone to try the place once but I bet there is better options in the Burg.",2 (3 stars),"I love the concept but I think it is overrated.

The staff seemed friendly enough, but they didn't go out of their way to make us feel welcome or provide any recommendations. The wait time for our food was reasonable, but it wasn't anything to write home about. Overall, I was just underwhelmed by the whole experience. I had high expectations based on the hype, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to them. I don't think I'll be rushing back to Primanti Brothers anytime soon.","Continuing from the first piece, I also found the service at Primanti Brothers to be quite disappointing. Despite the restaurant being busy, the staff seemed disinterested and inattentive. It took a while for our order to be taken, and even longer for our food to arrive at the table. The lack of efficiency definitely affected my overall experience.

Furthermore, I couldn't help but notice the lack of variety on the menu. While the concept of putting fries and coleslaw in a sandwich is unique, it would be nice to have more options to choose from. Perhaps adding some vegetarian or vegan options would cater to a wider range of customers. Additionally, offering different types of cheese, such as Swiss or provolone, would enhance the flavor profiles of the sandwiches.

In terms of the ambiance, I found the atmosphere to be quite loud and chaotic. The constant noise from the kitchen and the bustling crowd made it difficult to have a conversation without raising our voices. Some soundproofing or background music could greatly improve the dining experience.

Overall, while I appreciate the history and tradition behind Primanti Brothers, I personally feel that it falls short of the hype. The dry sandwiches, lackluster service, limited menu options, and noisy environment all contribute to my underwhelming experience. I believe there is room for improvement in order to truly live up to the reputation that Primanti Brothers has garnered over the years.",0.14,0.16,0.45,0.39,No,No,No
