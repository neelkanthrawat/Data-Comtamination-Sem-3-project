Right now I have to connect and then do a cmd+K in the finder to connect to the AFP share. It'd be nice if it would connect automatically.
The share doesn't have a password (TimeCapsule without any passwords, and no, not using it for backup, we use it for a fileserver).

A: 1.
Edit the file /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/client.up.osx.sh and add these"|"commands at the end of the file, just before exit 0 :
su USERNAME -c '
mkdir /Volumes/TimeCapsule
mount_afp afp://afp_username@server/volumename /Volumes/TimeCapsule
'
open /Volumes/TimeCapsule

Replace USERNAME with your username on the system.
2.
Then add the following at the end of /Applications/Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources/client.down.osx.sh :
umount /Volumes/TimeCapsule

3.
Do not forget to check the set nameserver option for your configuration : 

Warning : Configuration files client.(up|down).osx.sh are executed for every connections made using OpenVPN.
This could also be made using launchd for watching if the vpn connection is up, but I don't know how to use launchd.

A: I have just succeeded to auto-mount NFS after having connected VPN and auto-unmount before discconect with Tunnelblick (3.7.3 on macOS High Sierra).
At first, I had the same problem with Cameron Conner. Still, Studer's answer was quite helpful for me.
Instead of Studer's client.(up|down).osx.sh, I placed two lines in the .ovpn:
up (path to your connected.sh)
down (path to your pre-disconnect.sh)

Then create and edit these connected.sh and pre-disconnect.sh.
connected.sh:
#!/bin/sh
sudo mkdir /Volumes/NFS
sudo mount -P 192.168.0.1:/share /Volumes/NFS

pre-disconnect.sh:
#!/bin/sh
sudo umount /Volumes/NFS

I don't know about TimeCapsule manipulation. So above process is about NFS. I think you can arrange it for TimeCapsule.
I think the point Cameron and I got stucked was su or sudo. And, to avoid password is another problem. My solution to that was sudoers.
Edit /etc/sudores with visudo. Modify the %admin entry from:
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

to:
%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Unless your account is not an admin, it should work."|"#!/bin/bash

When I connect to windows servers (called PC-servers in OS X) getting the list of files in a directory is really slow (20-30s) in comparison to using a windows machine|"(<1s). Sometimes the files in a directory even disappear for a while! The network is not slow - copying files goes at 1Mbyte/s.

A: If you are using the Finder then try with another file manager or try run a ls in the terminal. Let us know if you are experiencing the same kind of delays using the command line.
Some good alternative file manager are muCommander and Midnight Commander. Try both.

A: I was able to speed up the directory listing by mounting shares via the command line, like this: 
mount -t smbfs //user@server/sharename share

So we still have our old phones with the old SIM cards in them. I've deleted the data off of the old phones, and I would like to sell them.
What do I need to do to sell the old phones? Do I remove the SIM from the phone and expect the buyer to put their own SIM in there? How do they go about getting a legit SIM from AT&T to put"|"in the phone? Or do they use the SIM that is in there? How can I be assured the old phones cannot be linked to my current account in any way?

A: One easy option, if you can use the store credit, is to sell them to Radio Shack for $200 [1].
If you prefer cold hard cash, or think you can do better than $200, there's a market for them on eBay, and it's easy to search for the going rate.  The phones will be easier to sell for more if you can jailbreak and/or unlock them in advance.  (How to do that is best left for another question.)
As for how a conscientious buyer activates your old phone through the proper channels, it's my understanding that once you've upgraded your line, your old phone can simply be brought into any AT&T store and associated with a new account.  I.e., you can & should sell the phone without a SIM.
Once it's been wiped and no longer has your SIM, the phone is no longer linked to you.

A: Gazelle.com specializes in buying and reselling or recycling old gadgets. They pledge to completely remove any user data.

A: Technically, once you get a new SIM, the old one is deactivated and no longer associated with your account, so you don't have to bother taking it out. I still would, just to be safe though.

4||"Q: iTunes Store: ""Your payment method was declined."" Last night I attempted to purchase an app from the App Store on my iPhone 4. The previous day I had purchased an app with no issues, and this time was told that my payment method was invalid. When I clicked 'Continue' to fix my information, everything was correct so I re-inputted my credit card security code and tapped done. No, fail, declined.
I called my bank as I am currently vacationing in Ireland, and if my debit card (the card my iTunes account uses) starts getting declined I will have issues. No, no problems, they had a note in my account that I was traveling, and there are no holds or flags on my spending. She also noted that the iTunes store had requested a verification of $0.99 but had not charged the card for the amount.
I returned to the iTunes store on my iPhone and attempted again to input my credit card information. Still declined. I entered a second credit card. Declined. I opened up iTunes on my laptop (OS X 10.6, iTunes 10) and checked my account information"|"there. No prompt about it being incorrect when I log in, unlike on the iPhone which tells me – even for free apps – that my payment method was declined as soon as I input my password.
I attempted to purchase the app from the store on my computer and sync it to the iPhone. As soon as I click on purchase, I am asked to authenticate. As soon as I authenticate, I am asked to fix my credit card information. As soon as I fix my credit card information, I am returned to the screen I was at previously where I elected to purchase this app (in this case, that screen is the home page of the App Store).
Two different cards, no issues with the bank, no way to get it working in iTunes proper on the desktop or through various attempts in the App Store in the iPhone. Any ideas? Any suggestions?

A: I actually had this issue before too. I am not sure what caused it, but after waiting a couple of days, it worked again. Here are people discussing it on the Apple Support Forums, but there doesn't appear to be a resolution. I think mine may have been a transient service issue or something. It never happened again after this. 

A: The ""official"" way to fix, per Apple, it is to email Apple's iTunes support (iTunesStoreSupport@apple.com), inform them of the problem, and then wait for them to fix it for you on their end. The good news about this solution is that my email was answered very quickly, the support person knew what the issue was and how to fix it, and within a couple days of telling them about the problem they had fixed it and I am up and working again.
After they told me it was fixed, it did take almost exactly 24 hours to take effect, and in the email they told me ""wait about 24 hours and try purchasing an app again.""
At the time I was having this problem (while traveling abroad) I was in no mood to ""wait it out"" as other answers have suggested, but since it was handled so capably and promptly by iTunes Support, I wouldn't suggest that as a course of action. It is a known issue for them.

A: THIS WORKED FOR ME
I spoke with my credit card company, they mentioned the name had to match EXACTLY as on your card, INCLUDING BEING IN CAPS.  Because there is no place for middle name, add it after first name in the app store credit card info, for example First Name: JOHN C Last Name: SMITH.  Once I did this, it worked.
Good Luck!

A: I keep getting this problem with Itunes and this is the way I solved it without contacting Apple. 
1. Make sure you have funds on your dedicated card
2. Check details with the bank and inform them of any details that cannot be entered correctly into itunes ie Title Itunes lists Ms, Mrs and Mr but not Miss. 
3. Take off all payment information on Itunes sign out of your account and close Itunes and leave it for about an hour and then re-enter the details.
This works for me but I cannot guarnetee if it will work for anyone else.

A: i solved it by logging out of Store in my iPad. Then re-login. At that point, it prompted me to check the payment details. I did the necessary and its gone.
Fire up iTunes in your computer logout, then login again. It should be resolved."|"A: I'm not sure if this is the answer you're looking for, but I'm going to post it anyway.
I'm not sure what the problem is, but I've had the same issue with my credit card. I've had to call my bank and have them change my credit card number.

A: I had the same problem and it was because of a security code on my credit card. I had to call my bank and they changed it.

*Do I"|"need to dual boot?



A: No, this will not work. You can have multiple versions of OS X on one machine, but you can only install newer versions than the one that came pre-installed. For example, if your machine came with 10.6.4, you can't run 10.6.3 or older.
When Apple releases new hardware, the drivers for that hardware get rolled into a special build of OS X that comes only on that model. They don't get added to OS X in general until the next point release. (That means that drivers for the hypothetical machine I'm talking about wouldn't be added until 10.6.5.)
Apple doesn't release drivers as standalone software, which effectively makes it impossible to install and older version of OS X than what your Mac shipped with. You'll find that if you put the install disc for an older version in the drive, it either won't boot or it will refuse to install.
However, you can go the other direction. If you have an old Mac running 10.5, you can use Disk Utility to make another partition (HFS+ Journaled), then boot the install DVD for 10.6 and install it to that partition. To switch between the two after installing, hold alt when you boot up. (You can also select the default boot partition through the Startup Drive pane in System Preferences within either OS X install.) Boot camp is not required for this. Boot camp is only required for installing non-Apple operating systems like Windows and Linux.

A: I would think partitioning the disk and using Boot Camp is all you need to do here.
If you don't have a 10.5 disk already, then you'll need to go through Ebay and sites of its ilk. Apple doesn't sell previous versions of OSes."|"need to install it on my machine?

A: Until Apple offers the ability to add some basic controls (eg. bold, etc.) on the iPhone/iPad (without the keyboard) it's not possible without copying and pasting from a previous message.
You could create a draft with the different types of list to copy and paste and use that.

A: Boot Camp"|"doesn't require you to reformat your drive. HFS+ partitions can be live-resized by the Boot Camp Assistant or the Disk Utility without going through the trouble of erasing everything. No file on your Mac OS partition will be affected.
There is, however, the case where you've had your computer for long and Mac OS has written files all across your drive. In this case, you will need to defragment your drive, in order to put all your files in a nice contiguous space on your hard drive, so that all the remaining space is contiguous too and a partition can be made there. As far as I know, iDefrag can do this for about $15. (Disclaimer: I never did it and can't guarantee it will work. But it should. Can someone confirm?)

10||"Q: How does Facetime compare to normal video calling? So, Apple is billing Facetime as though it is a revolutionary technology. I'm not going to ask you whether you think it is, as that is clearly a subjective question. What I will ask instead is how does it compare to normal video calling. Is there anything new that hasn't been done before?

A: Entirely new? No - not really, but the quality is quite acceptable (I'd say it's better than most Skype video calls I've had) and it's extremely painless to use. It's also at the present time far more limited in audience (only iPhone 4's, iPad 2's and Macs) than normal"|"video calling.
You can think of it as video calling built right into the OS with software that doesn't require hoops (no log in required) to jump through to use it.

A: As for your question, Is there anything new that hasn't been done before, then one could be generous and say that the no-account-required and it-just-works is quite nice, as is the elegant use of front or rear cameras and the ability to switch between them, and the automatic landscape/portrait modes. That's quite slick. But it's not a competition-killer.
On the whole, Facetime is the typical Apple feature -- very polished, but a limited feature-set, and only available to users on the exact same platform (in this case, only iPhone 4's, iPad 2's and Macs). That alone limits the usefulness of the app quite a bit.
For general-purpose video calling, there are general-purpose apps like Skype which do it better, and which even work over 3G (if you're lucky), and which aren't limited to specific Apple-only devices.
I'd recommend Skype over Facetime any day.
(Notice I didn't comment on the revolutionary issue either.)

A: You're obviously well aware of the long history of video calling implementations to ask this question, so

If you consider implementation and support costs of a video chat system as well as voice and picture quality, it's hard to say anyone is beating them at #2 either.

11||"Q: How do you position your hand to use the command key? What finger do you use? Sorry in advance about what seems like a trivial question.  However, I've recently switched from PC to Mac, and while I'm really happy about the switch, this is one of the few issues I'm struggling with.
On a PC, the most important shortcuts are CTRL-A (select all), CTRL-C (copy), and CTRL-V (paste). Almost all the other important shortcuts also use the CTRL key.
On the PC keyboard, the CTRL key is in the bottom left corner of the keyboard. So, it's very easy to hold it with your pinky, while keeping your hand in its normal position, so you can easily press the other key required for the shortcut (e.g., A, C, V, etc).
On a Mac, the ""equivalent"" key to CTRL is Command. However, I can't easily reach that key with any finger - especially without moving my hand from its normal position - so, I can't easily press Command-C or Command-V without really focusing on it.
Is this just a result of years of practicing on a PC? What finger do Mac users use to click the command key when executing a shortcut?

A: When I first made the switch to Mac I used System Preferences -> Keyboard to switch the ⌘ key with ^ (control) key. That worked for a while until I became"|"more comfortable with the basic two-key commands. Once I started using more complex three and four key commands I had to put it back to default because I needed the labels on the keys at first to remember what the symbols <-> key mappings were.

A: I mostly use my thumb. If I'm trying to hit a key that's more in the middle or right side of the keyboard (such as C or V), I use my ring finger.
Note that I'm a horrible typist, so I never use the right ⌘ key. If you're comfortable using that, you can probably just use your thumbs.

A: You can use either thumb to hold down a ⌘ key and then use another finger to access the other key. You just have to get used to sliding either thumb a little to the left or to the right of the space bar.
Yes, this is just a result of years of using a PC.

A: It's easier to type shortcuts if you use Sticky Keys as well. This way you can type shortcuts one key at a time, which might sound slower, but isn't if it means you can keep your hands in position and your eyes on the screen. 
I tend to use my thumb for command. I use my left pinky for control, shift and Fn, although it may be different for others as I keep my pinkies over the row below the home row. Alt is tricky, but I guess the pinky makes the most sense for me personally, usually.
There's nothing wrong in using different fingers at different times. For instance on the rare occasion I want to show the Dock (⌃⌥⌘F) I move my arm and use index on cmd, middle on alt and ring on control, then type the D afterwards.

A: I also thought it was inconvenient at start but later realised how good it is with the command button. I learnt to type on a keyboard with no markings which requires you to have all keys memorised and your fingers on the right position on the keyboard. By using the command button with your thumb (which is regularly only used for the space ), your fingers are always positioned correctly on the keyboard. Using the control button, you HAVE to use your pinky finger which makes your fingers leave the correct position, which in the end makes you look at the keyboard!
(by correct position i mean, pinky on A, ring finger on S, middle finger on D, long finger on F etc.)

A: Here is the official advice from Apple
On page 67, they state the following:

Use a light touch when typing or using the trackpad and keep your hands and fingers relaxed. Avoid rolling your thumbs under your palms.

Based on this, it would be my assumption that they intend you to either move your entire hand and use your thumb or pointer finger. If you find this unnatural, you can always change the control key to perform the duty of the command key. Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys, and change the buttons around as you see fit.



A: Very late reply but just giving my 2 cents as a long time Apple Magic Keyboard user who's been using a more standard keyboard layout for around 4 months.
Note: This only applies to the official Apple keyboards like the Magic Keyboard.
I have to disagree with some of the comments on the accepted answer which say to avoid using the thumb. Due to the Apple keyboards having a much smaller spacebar than the average PC keyboard layout, the thumb movement required to reach the Command key is very minimal. So minimal in fact, that the thumb knuckle is usually the only joint that requires movement and the amount of movement is generally within the natural range of the thumb. In other words, it's a very comfortable movement. That's at least how I feel and I have generally medium-small hands.
If however, you're using a non-Apple keyboard with a larger spacebar, yes, it's not advisable to use your thumbs for command as the additional movement required could cause you problems in the long run."|"accustomed to the Mac keyboard layout.

12||"Q: Upgrade time machine storage? I'm going to buy 2T external HDD to replace my already full 1T HDD external. I want to keep the time machine backup data. In this case, is it just OK to copy all the time machine backup data in 1T HDD to 2T HDD? 

A: I know this might be old, but here are the right steps to perform a Time Machine hard drive replacement preserving old backups, without having to use CCC or SuperDuper! (which I love, but are not needed). 
I have a Mac Pro so to make things more complicated I added Two drives and created a RAID-1 (Mirror); once the mirror was working, I proceeded with these steps (sans the “plug drive”) ;)
The above comment is to demonstrate that the volume composition doesn’t affect this. 
Like with any other Hard Drive operation, always make sure you have a backup or a way to restore your information in case something goes wrong. Read before you click “ok”. Use common sense and be careful. 
You need to be familiar with Disk Utility (located in /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app). It’s a very simple and straightforward application, but also very dangerous if you go coo coo and start clicking things without reading.
TIME MACHINE HARD DRIVE MIGRATION TO A NEW DRIVE PRESERVING BACKUP HISTORY


*

*Plug your new (presumably bigger) drive. Using Disk Utility, create the HFS+ Journaled partition (make sure you use GUID to avoid problems). Give it a name like: NewTM"|"(you can change that later). (This may be obvious but if you have a Mac Pro, turn it off before inserting the drives…) 

*Open the Time Machine configuration and turn off Time Machine. 

*Unmount the Time Machine drive (the ‘old’) and mount it again. This causes the drive to be mounted as a regular drive and not have the “Time Machine” Green Icon. (This is important). You can do that from Disk Utility. 

*Now go back to Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app) and click on the restore tab. 

*You will see two boxes to type, but you can also drag and drop, so drag the “TimeMachine” (old) to the source box (the upper one).

*Drag the new “NewTM” partition to the target box (lower one). 

*IMPORTANT: select “Erase Destination” so there’s a block level copy.

*Click restore and make sure that you have the right partitions (i.e.: read what you are being shown in the popup, it’s your last chance or you could erase your data.) When you’re satisfied, click ok to the popup and go cook. My 750gb took over four hours (and it was a SATA drive). Consider that USB drives (and even Firewire 800) are slower than any SATA internal drive. Some people reports this to take over five hours over USB for much smaller drives, so be patient.
Here’s how mine looked:



If everything went right, you should see two identical drives on your desktop, that is because the old drive was “fully duplicated” in the new one. The difference should be the free space, the new one should have more (if you are using a larger drive of course).
We’re almost done, but we need to activate Time Machine again. 


*Unmount the old Time Machine drive. If you are unsure which one it is, check the free space and/or physically disconnect it; don’t worry, you’ll be able to use it again soon.

*Open the TimeMachine configuration screen again and press Change Drive. Select the new one (should be the only one called Time Machine). The disk should now turn “green” with the Time Machine icon. Congratulations, you’ve migrated your Time Machine. 


What now?
Test it. Use Time machine to see if your files are there, recover some old files to see if they come, make sure everything is ok, you can reconnect your old drive and format it, or use it for furniture if you want. 
If you previously had Spotlight configured to exclude your Time Machine, you might want to make sure that everything is ok. Maybe you’ll have to drag the Time Machine drive again. Just check it. 
And that’s all. I hope you don’t destroy your data in the process. I came up with these steps by googling, experimenting and using common sense :) Hope it helps. 

A: I did some searching and found this (the caveat being that this applies to 10.5):

Using the Restore feature in Disk Utility, you can ""restore"" the Time Machine disk to another disk and retain the history of changes. This could be useful if you've outgrown your Time Machine backup drive, and want to migrate your existing backups to a new, larger drive. You should turn Time Machine off before doing starting this process, of course.
Be aware that the disks will have the same name and information, so it might confuse Time Machine. For example, after I activated Time Machine on the newly-created disk, I plugged in the old disk, and it showed up as a Time Machine drive, but the backup failed. It's probably best to avoid having both of them plugged in. At the very least, rename one of them.
Perhaps more importantly, Carbon Copy Cloner 2.3 doesn't work correctly for cloning a Time Machine drive (I don't know about 3.x), as it doesn't copy hard links but rather, copies what the links point to. This results in a lot of copies of your system when the Time Machine database has been around for a while.

The common suggestion from that thread is for CCC is to a block-to-block copy of the old disk to the new disk.

A: SuperDuper! works fine for me. I just changed my Time Machine disk last week and history is still there.

A: I think if you do 2 below steps can do it: 


*

*Turn Time Machine off before copy all time machine back up data to new HDD.

*Your new disk should have the same name(information) of old disk.

14||"Q: Where can I get install discs for OS X 10.5 to max out a Powerbook G4? Over the past year, my dad's Powerbook G4 (OS X 10.3) lost the ability to run any usable version of firefox or other end of life PPC software. Apple customer service wouldn't sell him a copy of 10.5 and told him to search ebay for copies of OS X 10.5, 8 months after releasing 10.6. We've been watching ebay and the price just keeps climbing above the original price.
I told him to buy a copy of 10.6 and the license should allow for installing older versions. He took it to a 3rd party Mac dealer and they said they couldn't install 10.5 if he doesn't own a 10.5"|"license (which no one will sell anymore). Does the OS 10.6 license cover older versions of OS X? Can 10.5 be obtained for the original price anywhere?

A: Firstly, I'm not sure where you heard that 10.6 shipped less than six months ago. It actually shipped in August 2009, making it over 12 months old.
Old system software tends to sell at a premium. I'm not sure why, but it may be at least partially because Apple no longer produces them. However, as Apple only sells 10.6 as a stand-alone OS (that is, it doesn't sell upgrade versions, just full) you can legitimately buy 10.5 from anyone with a copy who has since upgraded to 10.6.
There are plenty of places to buy 10.5 if you're willing to shop around. Keep an eye on this search and this search and see what turns up. For instance, this eBay sale is currently going for $40.

A: No the 10.6 license doesn't cover 10.5, and no, you won't find it anywhere for the original price.
I'm assuming his powerbook is running 10.4?  To be perfectly honest, 10.5 runs like crap on a G4.  I have a 1.67 PBG4 and firefox runs so slow that it's unusable.  Take a look at the PPC optimized builds of firefox at http://firefoxmac.furbism.com/.  Or try Opera, it's been much better for me.
Stick with 10.4, 10.5 will slow him down even worse!
edit
Since apparently I can't read, this answer may not have much relevance.  However, I'd still advise against moving up to 10.5.  If you can get your hands on 10.4, I think that would be the way to go.  Firefox and most other apps are still supporting 10.4.

A: So Apple will actually sell you a copy of OS X 10.5, Leopard, for $130 through 1-800-MY-Apple. They just tell you to look at eBay first, and will push back a few times before relenting and offering to sell you the upgrade.
Not everyone you talk to at Apple may know this, so you may have to talk to more than one rep. One of the leads at the local apple store knew this."|"install disc.

I want to know if a particular date (for instance, October 1, 2010) is a good date to go ahead and buy a Macbook pro, or|"whether I should wait few months for new models to come out. How can I figure out whether a computer I buy will soon become obsolete?

A: See the comments to improve the question, but Macrumors' buyers' guide always has suggestions if now is a good time to buy.

A: MacBook Pros aren't going to be updated until at least January, if you can wait 3 or 4 months, I suggest you do so.
However, if you need it before the end of the year, go for it. I doubt we'll see any major advancements anyway. You'll only miss out on slight speed bumps not a quantum computer."|"if I should wait for a better deal.

16||"Q: What jabber clients are there for iPhone? My girlfriend just got an iPhone, and we are wondering what are the available (and recommended) applications to chat using jabber.

A: There are a couple of apps, each one with their own unique features. If you're using the new iOS 4 on a multitasking-compatible iPhone (3Gs and 4), there's IM+ Lite, which provides multitasking support so that you can stay connected even when you're not running the app.

A: Trillian for iPhone is a multi-protocol IM client that supports Jabber among many others.  It's $5, but it's solid, good looking, and supports push notifications of IM messages."|"The push notifications are nice because you'll still receive messages if you're in another app or the phone is in standby mode.

A: I've used Meebo (iPhone only) and Beejive (seperate binaries for iPhone and iPad, link goes to iPhone). Both links go to iTunes. I own, use, and love Beejive, though I was quite miffed that I had to repurchase it for the iPad, and that they don't sync account data.
Beejive backgrounds, but it does not contain the connection on your device. You can close Beejive and kill it, and your connections will continue to run. This is because Beejive's servers maintain the connection for a specified period of time. (Specified in Settings.app -> Beejive section.) You will be notified by push or e-mail (configurable!) when you have a new message, if Beejive is not running. If Beejive is running, you'll get a ""local notification"". A notification generated by the app itself with the message content.
Some other clients run the connection FROM the device itself, and disconnect when the app is closed.
This is a security consideration you have to make when choosing an IM client for iOS.

A: A couple of friends of mine use monal, they say it is decent for a free app...

A: Since I can't put a comment yet, I will use ""answer"" posibility to comment given answers :) 
First of all, Gnoupi forgot to mention an important detail - we are searching for a jabber client for iPhone which we could use to connect with friends who are using other clients on pc.
I tried Trillian, it does look nice, indeed, but seems it gives possibility to contact only people with Trillian accounts? 
Tried Monal too, but it keeps hanging on ""logging in"", so can't even see if this is this what we search for :) 
IM+ Lite - I just read a description and indeed, this one seems to match our needs the best, I will give it a try! 

A: Monal IM
Works well with open Jabber servers. Even connecting using SSL."|A: There are a number of apps that support Jabber. I use the one that comes with the iPhone, but I'm sure there are others.|-0.9129047989845276|0.05882352941176471
17||"Q: Recommendations for purchasing low cost but Powerful Macs I've started to a lot of video editing with Adobe Premiere CS5 and After Effects CS5. I don't really have the money for a new Mac Pro. I feel that laptops are general underpowered and I have no need to be mobile.
Where should I look for low cost Intel Macs that fit my needs? In general, I don't think refurbished Macs from Apple are low cost.

A: How do you feel about a used machine? A one or two year old Mac Pro tower is still a very nice machine for video editing, and you could likely find one on eBay for a fraction of the cost of a brand new one.

A: For a while now I've felt that the best 'bang for buck' that Apple sell is the iMac range. 
The laptops are wondrous machines but they are expensive and they do top-out in terms of"|"performance at a certain point, and connectivity to other devices can become limited. The Mac Pro/towers are fabulous (I used to have a dual 2.5 G5) but you do pay a lot for that expandability and engineering - a quick look on eBay will show you that both the laptops and the towers can still command near-new prices, especially as Apple owners will often tend to get Applecare, keep the original packaging and use Apple-approved type parts and upgrades.
The Mac Mini unfortunately has increased in price as the spec has improved and I now think it's quite an expensive way to get a Mac.
A second hand Intel iMac, or even a low-end brand new one, gives a good mix of reasonable CPU, upgradeable memory (to a point), plenty of scope for FW800, FW400 and USB external connections as well as a potential internal hard drive upgrade if you get really desperate. It will happily drive an external monitor, something that in my experience people new to Mac don't realise (they think that it's all about the built-in screen and nothing else). 
It's obviously more of a commodity machine than the towers and that's reflected in the price - you can get an awful lot of iMac for the same kind of price as the entry-level laptop. And if you can find a second-hand or factory-refurbed model, even better!

A: Prices and availability on refurbished Macs directly from Apple vary from day to day (and sometimes hour to hour), and you can often get exceptionally good deals there. For instance, they've currently got a mini for 26% off ($589 versus $799). Yes, some days, there's nothing worth mentioning—but the following day, there might be, so it's worth checking back.
The best part of buying Apple refurbs, of course, is that they come with the same full warranty as Apple's brand-new hardware.
[Whoops, looks like the mini sold out while I was writing this, which kinda proves my point…]

A: Best way to get cheap Macs is from schools that are getting rid of old hardware. Granted most of that hardware is crap.
If you're near local schools (or cough eBay) take a gander through anything the photography classes are getting rid of. 
Also checkout refurbished computers directly from Apple. You mentioned that you don't find these low cost, but 15-20% off (in most cases) is pretty decent.
In terms of new computers, I would recommend one of the Mac Mini. It's a stout little machine, and doesn't tie you into a particular monitor."|"performance.
The iMac range is a great compromise between performance and price.

A: Dropbox is a good"|"idea, but since you are using Adobe Ideas, which has an ""email photo"" link, you could just use the Email Upload features of any photo sharing site (eg. Flickr email upload link, twitpic, etc.), and then copy the link from the browser.

A: It appears that you can't do so directly (darn it) so you'd have to do it indirectly. You can either sync it to a computer and then use that computer to ask your question, or upload it to a Web site and then manually use that URL for the image (via either Markdown or HTML).

A: Use Dropbox to upload it, then copy the link to the clipboard and paste it in your answer using the Markdown syntax: ![alt text](url)

A: I use photobucket, it's free has quite good features, and the iPhone app (not sure if there's a specific iPad app) works very simply, choose the photo, press upload, get the link.

21||"Q: How can I embed an image in an Apple Mail signature? I use Apple Mail daily, and up until recently I could have images inside my mail by referencing an external source. However the external source has since become unavailable, so ideally I would like to embed the images into my mail signatures. I am pretty good with creating the signature in HTML and create the webarchive for it, however have no idea where to begin as far as embedding the images are concerned.
Has anyone actually done this, or know of a very good resource that I can"|"use to figure it out?

A: You can simply drag an image file into a signature in Mail.
This will embed the image with in the email so all your future emails will include an attachment.
I sugest using a PNG as they are quite light-weight.

A: *

*Once the Mail program has launched, open the Mail application Preferences. This can be done by selecting it from the Mail menu bar option or by using the ""Command - ,"" keyboard shortcut, which simply consists of pressing ⌘ + , at the same time.

*Choose the ""Signatures"" option of the Mail Preferences window.

*Add a new signature profile by clicking on the ""Create a Signature"" button located under the second pane within the Signatures Preferences window. This button is represented by a square containing a plus (+) sign. See accompanying image.

*In the third pane located within the Mail Signatures Preferences Window, type the text of your email signature. You can also paste your text from another application, like Microsoft Word, Apple Pages or Apple TextEdit. Pasting from another application will maintain the text's font, size and style, if that is something you need or desire. Keep in mind that some fonts may not display properly on the email recipient's computer, depending upon the fonts you use and the fonts they have.

*Assuming that you have an image that you wish to add to your new signature, just drag the image from its location on your Mac (using the Finder) and drop it in the same pane where you just typed or pasted your new signature text. The image should appear next to or below your text. Make sure to use only web compatible images - JPG, PNG or GIF."|"use to learn how to do this?
