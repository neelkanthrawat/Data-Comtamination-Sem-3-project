Right. that's basically my opinion on it, right there, is that it's just, you know, I was in the same sort of situation as, it was a job interview and then you had a physical, where you were drug tested, and it's, I just, and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not, you know, been hired by a corporation which, uh, you know, I really.

SWBD-130,"A: Um, yeah, that's for sure. That's for sure, do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see? B: Well, it lo-, o-, the one trend I would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers, there are fewer of them home in the afternoons, A: Uh-huh. B:",it needs to be the mothers,"and I don't think it needs to be the mothers,"
SWBD-131,"A: Okay, looks like we're ready to go. Capital punishment, uh, the problem I have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime,",it really actually does that,but I don't think that it really actually does that.
SWBD-132,"A: Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this or, B: Uh, I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries or jobs, because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times. A: Yeah. B:",it should be allowable,And other than that I do not think it should be allowable.
SWBD-133,"A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B:",it should be unanimous,"Uh, I don't even think that it should be unanimous either. Uh,"
SWBD-134,"B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. A: No, no, not at all. B:",it was a well thought out incentive,I just don't think it was a well thought out incentive.
SWBD-135,"B: How about Ghost? A: we saw, an, we liked it",it was as good as all the hype was about it,"but, you know, I didn't think it was as good as all the, uh, hype was about it."
SWBD-136,"B: Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it, you know, uh, the go ahead to do it. A: Yeah. B: Because he had the fu-, he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us.",it was going to make such a mess,"Because I didn't realize that, um, it was going to make such a mess."
SWBD-137,"B: Oh, she was just funny. A: Really? B: She was really funny. And her character was good.",it was her in particular,I don't know that it was her in particular but just the character.
SWBD-138,"B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use.",it was his fault,"And I don't think it was my fault because you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it"
SWBD-139,"A: Yes. And, oh, yeah, it's very expensive. B: Oh. A: And, uh, B:",it was that expensive,I didn't realize it was that expensive.
SWBD-14,"B: Then I have another daughter in, uh, Bountiful, Utah and she has to work full-time and it's just tearing her apart. She has a private baby-sitter. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, the baby just screams. I mean, the baby is like seventeen months and she just screams. A: Uh-huh. B:",they're fixing to get ready to go over there,Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there.
SWBD-140,"A: and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise. So, see, you know, there's different, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem B: Uh-huh. A: and I know that. But then, I have other views to it. B:",it was that expensive,I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period
SWBD-141,"A: and that rolling kind of, uh, B: Terrain. A: Yeah. is fairly famili-,. The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics, apparently it's going to win everything. B: Really? A:",it was three hours long,"Uh, and I had been told, you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long, and all this, kind of,"
SWBD-142,"B: I did, too. A: I mean, it was just more for my money. B: Yeah.",it was too long,I didn't think it was too long at all.
SWBD-143,"B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it.",it works that way,"I just, don't think uh, that it works that way."
SWBD-144,"B: Uh-huh, uh-huh. How's that? I haven't seen that. A: I like it a lot. It's real different.",it would be a hit,"In fact, they never thought it would be a hit."
SWBD-145,"A: I don't think it's done. I don't think we run it as a deterrent. I mean people say that, but, I mean, if it was really a deterrent, I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west, you know, they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while. B: Uh-huh. A: And if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent, I would think that it would be public.",it would be this private thing,I mean I don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it.
SWBD-146,"B: but, you know, for other kind of cans, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they. A: Yeah, I don't, yeah,",it would crush steel cans,"I don't think it would crush steel cans,"
SWBD-147,"B: Uh, if they've got these bins for all the other little items, I'm sure if people will have batteries, uh, you know, quite often to toss out. A: Right, that's true. ",it would pick up their stuff,"Uh, when I was home those few days around Thanksgiving and uh, the truck came by, well, we all ran out to watch it because, you know, we'd never really seen it pick up our stuff"
SWBD-148,"B: That throws the budget out of whack real fast. A: Well, we actually planned for about one year. B: Oh, good. A:",it would take seven months,"Uh, that God because,, it never occurred to us that it would take seven months."
SWBD-149,"B: yeah, obviously we don't have any and I think that's part of the role reversal, is it's okay to get married and not have kids. A: Oh yeah. B: And I think society for such a long time said, well, you know, you're married, now you need to have your family",it's been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family,and I don't think it's been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family.
SWBD-15,"A: it's nice when it makes, a lot because you can feed your own family. And then, B: Yeah, because when I make this chicken casserole it makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze. A: Uh-huh. B:",they're not going to eat,"or I give it to my Mom and Dad if I know we're not going to eat,"
SWBD-150,"B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah. ",it's done,I don't think it's done.
SWBD-151,"A: Well, uh, and that's an idea that's been kicked around for a long time.",it's ever been seriously considered,"I don't know that it's ever been seriously considered, uh, as far as close to passing, uh, any legislation or anything like that."
SWBD-152,"A: No, I don't either. B: Uh, I mean it's, you know it, A:",it's going to change very much,I don't think it's going to change very much
SWBD-153,"B: But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. A: Uh-huh. B:",it's going to go very far,"Uh, I don't think it's going to go very far,"
SWBD-154,"A: I suppose so. Let me push the button. B: All right. A: Okay, uh, I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system, but, uh, I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon. B: Yeah,",it's going to happen,"I don't think it's going to happen either,"
SWBD-155,"A: for the moment, and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying, I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November, and you'll elect me again B: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. A: and then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said B: Uh-huh. A:",it's going to make much of a difference,"or you know, it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference."
SWBD-156,"B: Yeah. Well, that's the guy that counts. A: Yes. But, maybe we'll get your guy. B:",Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time,"Oh, I don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time."
SWBD-157,"A: Uh, such like, maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees. The other thing that juries are restricted on and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things even in my own experiences, that you usually don't get to hear all the information. B: Yeah. A: It's what information is presented",juries have a right to know more,"and, uh, I don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards,"
SWBD-158,"B: Well, that's true. A: I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is, uh, uh, there ought to be a",juries need to decide sentencing all the time,"well I guess I don't think that, uh, uh, juries need to decide sentencing all the time."
SWBD-159,"A: Yeah, but that, doesn't mean, B: But that doesn't eliminate it, does it? A:",making laws will stop it,I don't think making laws will stop it.
SWBD-16,"B: anybody tries to hurt them I won't even blink, A: I know,  No. I understand that.",someone's trying to hurt them,"uh, what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake?"
SWBD-160,"A: Oh, I can't either, not a one. B: And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field. A: Uh-huh. B:",men really took the time to work on that sort of thing,I don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing.
SWBD-161,"B: Yeah. How about Mister Rogers, is he still around? A: Yes. Yeah. They still show Mister Rogers.",Mister Rogers is making new Mister Rogers,"I don't think he's making new ones,"
SWBD-162,"A: What do you think about Robin Hood? B: Well, I work for school district and, uh, it has hurt us a lot. Uh, there has to be some way, I think, to equalize education opportunities. But, uh, you know, I think, especially big government, tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it. And I don't, you know, that's just not true.",money is going to take the place of intelligence,"you know, I don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or, uh, problem solving skills."
SWBD-163,"B: like the customer is always right and you know, no matter how crabby you might be over the phone, they are very understanding and, uh, they ma- make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise. A: That's really good. It use to be like that. B: Uh-huh. A: But, ",most places are like that anymore,I don't think most places are like that anymore.
SWBD-164,"B: That sounds really good. I read a thing, I don't even remember if it was in the Dallasite or the Insite one, about uh, companies allowing you, and they said that TI was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. Which I thought sounded like a good idea. You know, if you've been there, you know, under five years you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying, okay, I'm going to want an extra five days this year and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know, and they're deducting it all along, so you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time, you know, you're really not being paid for them, the money is actually coming out of your own pocket, but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know. So, that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and TI said that they were looking into something like that so, A: Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime. B: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. A:",none of the employees would have to purchase any extra vacation days if the company did that,"And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days, if they did that."
SWBD-165,"B: and I'm just here for the rest of the stay. And so you know, I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home, it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs. Yeah A: Uh-huh. B: they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore. Uh, I know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home. They generally were able to have someone care for them at home and they died. But they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents. Like they were in their eighties. That type of thing. Uh, but I did, uh, you know, I guess, uh, when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically. Uh, A:",nursing homes really do a very good job,But I just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job.
SWBD-166,"B: Yeah, and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it. A: No, not when you figure,",one cow produces that much manure,I didn't realize one cow produces that much manure
SWBD-167,"A: Uh, at, uh, it's TCJC. Tarrant County Junior College. B: Oh. A: Yeah. B: Okay. A: And it's really enjoyable. I like it. And then they also, you know, do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption,",people can make laws to eliminate something every place totally,and I don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally.
SWBD-168,"A: Yeah, that's crazy. B: and then you come here in the Dallas area, um,",people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles,I don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles.
SWBD-169,"A: But, I mean, uh, is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world? If they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences,",people want to be taxes to build more prisons,"and the people in various states, it does not seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons. Or even for that matter, uh, repair uh, the lack of judges and other, uh,"
SWBD-170,"B: but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too. A: Yeah.  True. B: Because it's, we've all got to do it right now. I just, I really amazed to find out that, eighty per cent are filled now, in garbage fills. In five years we're supposed to be at max. A: Uh-huh. B:",she can keep her own garbage,I don't think I can keep my own garbage.
SWBD-171,"A: Yeah. Koontz. Uh, his last name ends in a Z, I know that. B: Yeah, oh, I think I know who you're talking about. Uh, I've seen,",she can pronounce it,"I don't think I can pronounce it either,"
SWBD-172,"A: Is, uh, kind of fun. It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now. And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal. Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet,. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have.",he could afford the boat,"Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time,"
SWBD-173,"B: I think I've been trout fishing once. I've never fly fished. Have you fly fished? A: Uh, no I haven't.",she could do that,I don't know that I could do that.
SWBD-174,"B: If you compare like the people that could have sent their kids to private schools and you know, the people that, uh, did send their kids to private schools. A: Yes. B: I think they compare you know, fairly well. A: Yeah. Yeah.",she could have done much better than she did in the school system she was in,"I mean, I honestly don't really think I could have, you know, done much better than I did in the school system I was in."
SWBD-175,"A: And, uh, I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do, but now I could not go back and do it. B: Yeah. A: I really couldn't,",he could stay home all the time and do nothing,I don't think I could stay home all the time and do nothing.
SWBD-176,"A: Yeah. Well, Do you have anything else to say? B: Well,  No, not too much more about credit cards. A: Okay.",she has more to say about credit cards,I don't think I do either
SWBD-177,"B: Well that's true. You're right, you know, by the time you've finally got down to it, I was hoping I could remember where all those other things went. A: Well that's kind of the way I was, I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it went,",he had too many nuts and bolts left over,and I don't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together.
SWBD-178,"A:  nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever. A: Yeah. B:",she has a philosophical problem with that,I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.

SWBD-180,"B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. A: Uh-huh. B: That was fun. A: Golly,",he has heard of that movie,I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.
SWBD-181,"A: when I started thinking about this, those are some of my favorite shows, McGyver, because it's only one person there, uh, you know, instead of a cast of people, B: Uh-huh. A: but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap, and grabbing what he can and, you know, pieces of baling wire and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and, B:",she has heard of that show,I don't think I've even heard of that show.

SWBD-188,"B: Yeah. It's, uh, I have modem night computer so I can log into the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which can be useful. But, uh, yeah that and word processing is while I tend to, I mean, obviously, I do almost all of my report writing on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember,",he has used a typewriter to do a report,"actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. TRS Eighty when they first came out."
SWBD-189,"B: Well, I know I'm in the, you know, the only reason I asked about secondary schools or, you know, advanced education is because down here, you know, going to the University of Texas, the education I'm getting I think is kind of shoddy for a public school.

SWBD-190,"A: But it seems to me uh, that the budget is so out of hand, and especially now that they say, Okay, the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend you know of X number of billion, trillion dollars a year. B: Uh-huh.

SWBD-20,"A: That is the way to do it. I mean, and that's, you know, at least the Air Force is, I do not know, uh, I am nervous in Dallas. I mean, you know, I mean, I go to like an aerobics class or something. And, you know, uh, seventy women in a Jazzercise class in a public, uh, parks and rec building. And you are supposed to feel safe, but then there are all these, does not matter race, but, you know, it is an inter racial mix. And you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards. B: Yeah. A: And I do not even think that way, but I mean, you just think to yourself, you just, I mean,",it can't happen to them,nobody can think that it can't happen to them.
SWBD-200,"A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue.",he would blame it directly on the school,I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.

B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision,",she would do it to her parents,but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally.

SWBD-204,"B: So did I. My Masters, anyway. A: What, but, uh, when I look at it to me, uh, it doesn't really make any difference. It was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done,",he would have gone on unless he had that financial easement made possible,"I don't think I would have gone on, unless I had that financial uh, easement made possible."
SWBD-205,"B: and, uh, that then ends up being the most common example for me. A: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: Um, I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this one that you raised. A: Yeah. B:",he would have thought about that,And I don't think I would have thought about that.
SWBD-206,"A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A:",he would like the KGB monitoring his phone,I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.

A: Well. B: Um, I don't really think that it's, uh, too many, I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, well, we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, uh, you know, worthy of working for us. I really don't see that that's a very valid, uh, thing for a company to say,",he would work for somebody if they were going to reject him on the basis of what's inside his body,"and personally, I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body."
SWBD-208,"A: and I'm saying to myself, well, you know, you dump your little turnip off to, uh, you know, this child care place and they don't pay very much and why would they be interested in your little turnip unless, you know, one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest, you know.

SWBD-21,"B: Uh, yes. Well, they find it is more deterrent. A: Well, my sociology class at SMU's taught us that it was not a deterrent. Uh, but now that's just what they said. Uh, I don't know",it is a deterrent,maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent.

SWBD-215,"B: Uh, do you feel that yours is invaded? A: Uh, no I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means. Uh, you know, I would, there's a lot of times though, uh, you get those calls you know, when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or whatnot and, you know, next thing you know, uh, someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to tell them, you know, that you're not interested. Or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you, you know, and keep badgering you about it, and that aggravates me.",someone could call that invading her privacy,But I don't know that you could call that invading my privacy

A: Yeah,",she reads anything strictly labeled self improvement,I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.
SWBD-218,"A: So that's not too bad. B: No, uh, I really think that, here in Indiana at least we pay uh, just too much tax.

SWBD-224,"B: And other than that I do not think it should be allowable. I think it should be illegal for them to want to do that. it's kind of the big brother syndrome, I mean, I just, anything like that just kind of scares me. A: I tend to view it,",she would work for a company that did that,"even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that, I sort of want to defend an employer's rights uh, in addition to an individual's rights,"

How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps.

SWBD-233,"B: Um, in fact, Los Alamos, uh, has, uh, done a fair amount of research, uh, in recycling things in general. Um, it involves, for instance, uh, creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, uh, other things from, uh, waste material in general. uh, and purify the waste of specific, uh, uh, nasty elements.

SWBD-235,"B: Well, that's the same thing that I did. I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren. A: I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes. At least my daughters have. They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. So it's worked pretty well. There's,",something has been broken,I don't really think anything's been broken.
SWBD-236,"A: And it's brought the, they, uh, really listen to the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies uh, you know, have really pushed, they, all those restrictions are really too hard, we can't quite make that go and they don't and then we still live with air pollution. B: Yeah. A: Um, so I suspect that that's one thing that as individuals, we can do, make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators. But, um, as a society, I think we can do more and that's probably how we ought to do it. Uh, being individually responsible in order to be group responsible. B: Yeah,",something will happen if there's something economically justifiable about it,I guess I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless there's something economically justifiable about it.

A: Uh-huh. B: Um. you know, in the past, I don't know how old you are, but when I was, uh, in high school, it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth. And many of my peers were being drafted. A: Uh-huh. B:",many of her peers had conscientious objections to war,And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever.
SWBD-240,"B: Right. Well, for instance, does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her and she came up negative.

I thought, Christ, they're letting me in, to, you know, B: Yeah. A: this would be frightening. I don't know anything about it. B:",someone can teach it,That's pretty interesting just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it.

SWBD-246,"A: Is, uh, kind of fun. It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now. And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal. Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have. Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore, so things change, I guess. What are your memories of boating, or current, B: Uh, about the only memories that I have of boating, uh, my husband's family had a motor boat, uh, when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times. And, uh, I really did enjoy that.",she ever learned to drive the motor boat,"I don't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything,"
SWBD-247,"A: That's right, that's right. B: Uh, I don't have other than a reading and male perspective on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not. Uh, my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent.",he felt himself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs,"I don't know that I, uh, felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs."
SWBD-248,"A: you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things. We di-, for us it really took, you know, a business application to justify the expense of it. B: Uh-huh.  Oh, definitely, definitely. I know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer, oh, I guess, probably three years ago for Christmas, and, you know, it's got some stuff on it. It's got a nice little word processing software on it, you know, and some budgeting type things and stuff.",her mother has ever touched the computer,And I don't think she's ever touched it you know.
SWBD-249,"A: Yeah. Now that's a very good suggestion. B: Uh, just something to, i-, rather than throw someone into that environment, uh, you know, it A: Yeah.",student teaching is enough,I don't think student teaching is enough.
SWBD-25,"A: I got a friend who goes there, by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay. B: Okay. Uh, I've, the high school I went to uh, was a good one also.",one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools,"And well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools."
SWBD-250,"A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah,",switching back and forth is that big a deal,I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.
SWBD-251,"A: Yeah, I had a friend whose brother did steroids and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out. It all turned to fat and he just, really looked bad. B: Really.  Ugh. A: But, uh, B:",taking steroids did that,I didn't know it did that.
SWBD-252,"A: And now it's election time again so they're trying to lower them. B: Oh. A: So they're just talk about lowering them but they never do, they just keep raising them. B:",taxes would really go down,I've never seen taxes really go down.
SWBD-253,"B: Yeah, I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else. A: Right, you know, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat. But,, I'm wondering if there's another issue here, and maybe this is why this has died out. Can you go into, and this wasn't the question but it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults, can they go in there and can anyone go well, out of the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time, but say, I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and it doesn't do any good. B: Yeah. A:",teaching them to farm does any good,I don't know that it does.

A: And I think they've had it for several years.",Texas Instruments' program had a lot of problems associated with it,"And their program they had, I don't think had a lot of, uh, problems associated with it,"
SWBD-255,"B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling",that attitude would stay negative very long,but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.

SWBD-257,"A: That, so that's, and I don't know, you know, I think about, well, the dress code they have for the kids, you know. Are they put one on the parents, or the teachers and say the men have to wear ties and there can be no blue jeans worn and, because some of the teachers I know wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, you know, they'll wear it with a nice top.",that looks bad,"and, uh, I don't know that that looks that bad."
SWBD-258,"B: I, think because they were scheduling a video release of it in July and then when it won all those awards, uh, they pushed it back to August, so. But, yeah, that one is definitely worth seeing, it's really good. A: Now did you see, uh, Driving Miss Daisy? B: Yeah,",that one was as good,"and you know, I didn't think that one was near as good."
SWBD-259,"A: and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and you know, put another gallon of glass bottle in there. B: Yeah.

SWBD-262,"A: now we had one, this was before I lost a lot more of my family, but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway. Because I didn't have any of them left. B: Uh-huh. A: But, um, they had, uh, uh, thing where everybody could come and meet and go out to eat. B: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. A:",that was as good,"But, I didn't think that was as good. Because, it was like, you know, you couldn't really talk and stuff, like you could when, you were at the lake, or somewhere, you know, where you were out."

Which I had never thought about before. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.

You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them",that's done much anywhere,"uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere."

I mean, I see, I am more, I don't know about anybody else,",she's nuts,"and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts,"
SWBD-270,"A: I work in the airline, marketing group. B: Oh. A: So, we do a lot of, B:",the airline had anything like that,I didn't even know they had anything like that.
SWBD-271,"A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage.",the American people are being shortchanged by the news coverage,"I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage."
SWBD-272,"B: Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's right. A: But, uh, B:",the Astros would play,I've never seen the Astros play.
SWBD-273,"B: our land is in acres, our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is. A: Right.  Yeah, I agree with you. I don't think we should either even though I know there are benefits to the metric system,",the benefits of the metric system outweigh the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America,I don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America
SWBD-274,"A: Yeah, when they, you know it was funny, I can remember, and my mother and I have talked about it, how important it was when I came home from school. B: Um. A: It wasn't really conversation, but there were always things that just tumbled out. B: Yes. A:",the child is sharing it,"And, uh, uh, granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it, but it,"
SWBD-275,"A: So, I don't know I'm looking for a good year. I guess we're always looking for a good year. B: So, obviously though, do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this year or who do you like to do that this year? A: Uh, no",the Cowboys have got a chance,I don't think the Cowboys have got a chance.
SWBD-276,"B: Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from, A: Um. B: well, actually, I had uh, a Dodge Omni at one point A: Uh-huh. B:",the Dodge Omni was a very quality car,"and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car."
SWBD-277,"A: Well, because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind, uh, he sleeps in the laundry room and then he goes out for the day. But this is a beautiful dog and he is wonderful with our little girls and he's, comes from a purebred line and there's nothing you could say bad about him, except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle. B: Right.  Right. A: And this is huge. You know, course, when he runs around the yard, he just digs,",the dog's tearing up things,"he doesn't know that he's tearing up things,"
SWBD-278,"A: Oh, it wasn't that good. B: Well, oh, from a woman's point of view it was very, uh, chauvinistic as far as women go. Uh, it was entertaining, but, yeah,",the general audience would go for it,I don't think the general audience would go for it.
SWBD-279,"A: Yeah. I hope. That's true. B: You know, I, that's the kind of people,",the guy who's going to rob Seven Eleven is going to rob a Seven Eleven whether he as a gun  knife  or baseball bat,"like I say, I don't think the guy who's going to rob a Seven Eleven, is going to rob a Seven Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife, baseball bat, or, you know, whatever,"
SWBD-28,"B: Might be worth it for peace of mind. A: Oh, yeah. It is, it is.",somebody's been reporting on speaker B,You might even find somebody's been reporting on you
SWBD-280,"B: everyone I talk to, they says, you know, it's real easy to say that. A: we didn't damage enough of their arsenal. We damaged most of it but we should have made sure we got everything. B: Yeah,",the higher ups were thinking about what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine,I don't think the higher ups were thinking about what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine.
SWBD-281,"B: And it will send out a flower spike. You will see them blooming now. It is a wildflower here, but you can get them in the nursery. A: I am looking for a pen. I want to write this down because, well, that is where I went this year. Because I waited too late to really plant stuff. But I did not know that these hyacinths, like I said, I do not know anything about plants.",the hyacinths died,I did not know the hyacinths were going to die.
SWBD-282,"A: And you also get a lot of, uh, juries are extremely, uh, and from what I hear, I have some friends who do expert witness testimony and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know, the prosecutor will want to, oh, I don't know show the mugging victim, you know, show the nice person he was and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that was, uh, you know, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corporation. let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that. B: Uh-huh. A: So, not, I mean, I'm, the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury, but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be, things like that. B: Ri-, ",the judge should just make the decision alone,I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone.
SWBD-283,"A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too.",the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down,I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.
SWBD-284,"A: Boy that's scary, isn't it. B: Oh, can you imagine, because it happens in the middle of the night,",the kid was gone,"so you know, these parents didn't know the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming, let me in."
SWBD-285,"B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more,",as many parents are college educated at the public school,"and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,"
SWBD-286,"B: That's true. A: uh, you know, to,",the kids don't benefit from the bigger house,"I don't think, you know, the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars, and this type of thing."
SWBD-287,"B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to,",the law will change,"I mean, I don't think that law will ever change."
SWBD-288,"B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding.",the one solution to school funding will be necessarily the best way,I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way
SWBD-289,"B: Yeah, I mean it's. True. Yeah. A: I think that's a lot more realistic. Uh, I think that we should be spending more time",the Peace Corps is as successful now,and again I don't think the Peace Corps is as successful now simply because it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.
SWBD-29,"B: Might be worth it for peace of mind. A: Oh, yeah. It is, it is. You might even find somebody's been reporting on you and you didn't even know it.",speaker B is paying something on time,"You know, I mean you might think you're paying something on time"
SWBD-290,"B: Right, I think I've seen some statistics that say that, uh, it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life. A: Right because you've got all the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses. B: Right. A:",the people that are committing the eligible crimes really care,"Uh, and, you know, it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. Uh, for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible, you know, really care."
SWBD-291,"B: Okay, I don't know, which end do we push but okay, A: Okay, well, um, let's see,",the peoples' opinions are going to be heard,"I think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their, uh, opinion is going to be heard"
SWBD-292,"A: I think so, I think, B: I really do. Oh, yeah, it's going to take, uh, you know,",the police can do it alone,"the police, I don't think can do it alone, you know."
SWBD-293,"B: I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and, uh, that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor can't afford it either, but, uh, I really feel like and I feel like, you know, I'm a middle class person income wise anyway and, uh, I get tired of supporting the whole country. A: Yeah, so do I. I mean, I'm middle class barely,",the rich are paying not enough,"but, uh, I don't think the rich are paying not enough,"
SWBD-294,"B: Uh-huh. Well are you into that rock music, you know, all that druggy stuff and all that I mean? A: Well, uh. B: You know what I am saying I mean like they come on the stage and like, you know, you,",the rock musicians are there,they don't even know they are there. You know.
SWBD-295,"A: How do you feel about that. B: I don't really, I more, I don't know about the government as much as, uh, the people, uh, I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all",the Soviet Union itself is a threat still,and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore.
SWBD-296,"B: So the original question, do we think they're you know, a security threat? A: Yeah. B: Um, yes and no. A: Yeah, I can go with that answer too. The only yes I could go to is if uh, a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to a nuclear exchange, but I don't even see that occurring. Uh, because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to I guess. B: Um, no. ",the Soviets really want to blow up the world,"Well, I don't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world."
SWBD-297,"B: Because too often, there can be extremism that hurts from any direction, regardless of whatever you're arguing or concerned about. A: Yeah.  Right. Yeah, I know, you're right, they would lobby that and I see that, and that's why, you know, I'm like, okay, what's my role in this thing,, you know, what's my part, B: Yeah. A:",the system is going to get fixed,because I don't think the system is going to get fixed.
SWBD-298,"A: yeah, getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that, and having a lot of vacation. B: Right.  it really, um, I don't think most of our teachers, now I'm not a teacher, I am a secretarial executive assistant,",the teachers could stand the stress all year long,but I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all year long frankly.
SWBD-299,"B: Well, that's I meant when I said the school. A: Yeah. I don't blame it on the teachers in the school. although I think that, I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than, well, they do quite well for themselves. B: Huh.",the teachers in her school district were well paid,"Well, that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district, uh, were well paid."
SWBD-3,"B: And, uh, I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, so I shopped around,",she wanted to pay the amount of money,"and if I had thought I, uh, wanted to pay the amount of money, I probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an Accord or even a Civic, or something comparable from Nissan or Toyota,"
SWBD-30,"B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me.",the worst thing that's happening in the modern world is television,"I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television."
SWBD-300,"A: And then he has backed out, he has pulled out. And I realize they're still saying, well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein, so why aren't you helping us? And you see, I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation. B: I think it would too. A:",the U.S. will stand for it,And I don't think the US will stand for it.
SWBD-301,"B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news. A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A:",the way she gets the news is the right way to get it,I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.
SWBD-302,"B: I mean, you know, he's so messed up. A: Right. B: And, um, this was a nice, sweet, young man who, teenager, you know, and he's now a young man about twenty, I guess, who, um, just got really down the wrong path. A: Right. B:",the young man's problem would ever have been detected by drug testing,"And, uh, you know, I don't know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing."
SWBD-303,"B: That was surprising to me. A: Um. B: I missed that question, totally, I mean really bad. I'm trying to think, I didn't miss too many, I can't remember what my score was, but I did exceeding well. I was surprised.",their garbage isn't being decomposed,But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.
SWBD-304,"B: It's, uh, I don't know, I don't really liken it to alcohol but, yet that can be carried to an extreme, too. A: Uh-huh. B: So I think it's a good idea and I think just the idea you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're, A: Right. B:",their job would be at risk,"I don't know that their job would be at risk,"
SWBD-305,"B: And it seems like when the winds blow, it goes right through you. It's really different from Utah's weather. I thought Utah was cold, but I think Iowa is a lot colder. A: Yeah, see, that's how it is in Texas, too because when it's cold, it's really cold. So, B: Yeah,",there are some mountains to stop the wind,I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind.
SWBD-306,"B: And the long-range views are just kind of, become a thing of the past. A: Yeah you, B: And, uh, A:",there can be some more long range planning,I don't think there can be anymore long range planning.
SWBD-307,"A: uh, that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal. B: That's true. That's true. A:",there has been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news,So I don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news.
SWBD-308,"B: If, uh, you've some kid uh, who's from a broken family, the schools are supposed to fill that void. It's gotten way beyond uh, you know, teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like, oh, were kind of traditionally the school's roles. A: Yeah.  Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A:",there is a problem,"Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem"
SWBD-309,"B: Anyway, I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody making a decision what to do with them. A: Um, yeah, I guess that's not an easy solution. there's no easy solution for that. B: Uh-huh. ",there is an easy solution,"I don't know that there is an easy solution,"
SWBD-31,"A: And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, uh, B: Right. A: they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth, and he was definitely,",the man was in need of nursing home care,"just by looking at him and the way he acted, you could tell he was in need of nursing home care,"
SWBD-310,"B: Is Texas one of them? A: Texas is not one of them see. So, I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass. B: Yeah. No,",there is enough being done,I don't think that there is enough being done.
SWBD-311,"A: Well, got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone there? B: No,",there is some such thing as a crime free zone,"I don't think there is any such thing, as a crime free zone any longer."
SWBD-312,"A: and I guess I would like, I don't know, the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a crime problem either. B: Oh, really. A: No, you can't, they don't execute anybody in Britain or France and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either and they don't have the crime problems we do.",there is too much of a relationship between the two,I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.
SWBD-313,"B: Well, you've got, well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such, A: Uh-huh. B: And they get out their little Mac tens, they get out their little uzis and they're going to fight with them. And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm. If they want it they'll get it. I don't care if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border. Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon, anyway. A: Uh-huh. B:",there should be that big of a restriction on it,"Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it."
SWBD-314,"A: that's one difference. There really wasn't a lot of difference. B: I didn't,",there was a book tied in with that movie,see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie.
SWBD-315,"B: Although they've got, uh, Meals On Wheels, Which I understand is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh. So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice. B: No,",there was a whole lot of choice,"I don't think there was. Um,"
SWBD-316,"A: But, uh, B: Yeah, yeah.  But it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes and, of course, it was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake, but I just thought that was grand.",there were all those lakes out there,"And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,"
SWBD-317,"B: It's kind of neat. A: Yeah, what does a computer club do.",there were such things as computer clubs,I didn't know there were such things.

SWBD-319,"B: Yeah, and it almost seems like in order to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find, say in the Bobsy twins or, something like that. A: Right.  You know, I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out.",there would be too many left,I don't think there would be too many left.

SWBD-320,"B: Uh, which I am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done. A: Uh-huh. Uh, yeah, uh, uh, I guess, I hate to see anyone die, uh B: Uh-huh. A:",these people that go around and kill children  women  and everything else without any remorse deserve to live,"but, uh, I guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse, uh, I don't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives."
SWBD-321,"B: And they have said no. A: Yeah and then during the week you see these women, in the you know, just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know. B: Yeah. A:",these women would wear shorts without hose,"I mean I've never seen them do it without hose,"
SWBD-322,"A: so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion. B: Right. Well, for instance, does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her and she came up negative. A: Well, no,",they can force another company to not drug test her,"I don't think they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I didn't, I mean,"
SWBD-323,"B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards.",they can really do something to change it,So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.

SWBD-325,"A: Oh, well, what kind of paint did you use for the, um, bookends?

SWBD-327,"B: but, um, at least they all seem to have, uh, you know, people that monitor their, uh, medication intake and dining facilities, you know, go to the dining room and eat some good meals. A: Uh-huh. B: I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in, I mean, very antisocial. Maybe it takes a while for them to say, okay, well I'll be with other people but, A: Adapt. B: Yeah,",they don't want to be with anybody else,"I don't understand that, they don't want to be with anybody else."
SWBD-328,"A: The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes B: Yes. A: you know, it's not just a matter um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy, and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, and I wonder um, if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion. B:",they educate the jurors enough to really know what's going on,I don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on.
SWBD-329,"A: They, probably not enough, but I'm sure I lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind, of what they're missing out on. B: Yeah, I think they're starting to realize, but I just don't think they have the resources, if you were to compare, uh, the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or Fax machines and cellular phones, and state of the art equipment that we are so used to.",they even realize what's out there,"I don't think they even realize what's out there, and to what extent."
SWBD-33,"B: The kind you have sounds very interesting, though. A: Well, um, they're really sweet dogs.",their neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place because of the family that had them and bred them,"uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and bred them."
SWBD-330,"A: Yeah, that's true. B: But, I have been watching these houses go up and I don't, well, somebody was telling me, I know somebody who lives back there, I have always questioned the quality of construction",they exceed more than twelve nails per house,and I don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house.
SWBD-331,"A: and I guess I would like, I don't know, the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a crime problem either. B: Oh, really. A: No, you can't, they don't execute anybody in Britain or France",they execute anybody in Germany or Italy,and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either.
SWBD-332,"B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community. A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another",they feel the closeness that they used to be there,and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame
SWBD-333,A: it was so fattening. B: That sounds good. A:,they gained any weight from it,"But, I don't think we gained any weight from it"
SWBD-334,"A: Uh-huh. Yeah, but on the other hand, you know, if they would have had a hard time retaliating because you know, they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes. B: I see.

SWBD-336,"A: it could still happen then. B: Yeah, that's true, but you'd be surprised also how, much people watch you that even not, uh, participating in any type crime. I guess there was one case, I was surprised, uh, so happened this person worked at the same place, I work for Georgia Tech and they work at the same place I did,",they had been watching her,but I didn't know that they had been watching me
SWBD-337,"B: Yeah. That's what I was going to say. It's the chicken and the egg thing. I wonder, I mean, a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise, A: Right. B: and you get, I mean, it's been a while since I been in high school. They're even in grade school when they do that. But I can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that.",they have a chance of doing anything,"But you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything, and take it out on the school."
SWBD-338,"A: Uh, well, that gets. Some of the punk, um, when I was in high school, that was, uh, one of the big things, was punk music, and, uh, or some of it has a lot to say, the lyrics do, but the actual, B:",they have a whole lot to say,"I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even."
SWBD-339,"A: The flavor is better I think in between. B: Oh, in between the size wise yeah, A: Yes, yeah. B: yeah. A: Uh-huh. My mother, B:",they have any flavor the way he cooks them,"Well, my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them."
SWBD-34,"A: Um, my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen just what went into the something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers. B: Uh-huh. A: I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your phone and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not. B: Uh-huh. A:",their phones were not for commercial using,"Um, but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using"
SWBD-340,"B: And the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey. Not everybody can play hockey. A: Yeah. B: So we, and that's, we're a big hockey area up here, I bet up here in New England as well as, you know, in the Minnesota area A: Really. B: but, A:",they have hockey in Texas,I don't even think we have that in Texas.
SWBD-341,"A: Well, church softball leagues, so, B: Uh-huh. A: they're not all boys and right now we don't have a girls' league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one and I just haven't gotten around to doing it. I keep saying we need to have one. They go, okay, then start one. But everybody wants to do it but, you know, God's sitting on my heart and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it, so they could really only have four members on the team. I think they only have four boys.",they have only two old enough to play,I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.
SWBD-342,"A: but that is one of my solutions. Uh... B: I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections.",they have seen a really high improvement,And I do not think they have seen a really high improvement.
SWBD-343,"A: Because they're, I guess that falls, and one of my other favorite shows is Sesame Street because of the kids. I like that real well. B: Right, well, when my kids were little, I did have a TV set and I did watch a lot of Sesame Street and a lot of Electric Company, as well. A:",they have that on anymore,I don't think they have that on anymore.
SWBD-344,"B: Uh, my son's teacher has twenty-seven students. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis. Uh A: Yeah.  Perhaps. B:",they have the authority to command the attention of the children,"but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children."
SWBD-345,"A: They, probably not enough, but I'm sure I lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind, of what they're missing out on. B: Yeah, I think they're starting to realize,",they have the resources,"but I just don't think they have the resources, if you were to compare, uh, the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or Fax machines and cellular phones, and state of the art equipment that we are so used to."
SWBD-346,"A: And I think that, it's one thing to, uh, voluntarily give it because someone asks. You can always refuse but it's another thing where it's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. You know, B: Right. Uh, That, A:",they have the right to do that,I don't think they have the right to do that.
SWBD-347,"B: And you know, we had all the necessities, so. And I very seldom use a credit card on necessities. I always use it for something I want not something I need. A: Exactly. B: So, A: Yeah, my parents are really good about not using credit cards. They are against it. B: Yeah. A:",they like the fact that he has one,I don't think they like the fact that I have one either.
SWBD-348,"A: But, I'm not real sure that we promised them anything. B: Uh-huh. A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A:",they did it,and I don't think we did it.
SWBD-349,"B: And, uh, I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also. A: That's re-, yeah. B:",they read all the right things,I'm not saying they read all the right things
SWBD-35,"B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago,",they had the recycling going on then that they should have now,"but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass"
SWBD-350,"B: And so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation. And, of course, that's when he said well you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's, you render unto God what is God's. A: Right. B: And, uh, you know, of course, there,",they really cared about the answer,"I don't think they really cared about the answer,"
SWBD-351,A: Your turn. B: Okay.,they should abolish it,"Uh, I don't think they should abolish it."
SWBD-352,"B: And they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. A: Uh-huh. B: And, you know, that's about the only thing.",they should do that,"Like for theft and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, I don't think they should do that."
SWBD-353,"A: Do you think they should spend more? B: Uh, I think they should, actually, although perhaps not an incredible amount more than what they're doing,",they should fund AIDS research,"and I don't necessarily think that they should, uh, fund AIDS research and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever."
SWBD-354,"A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on",they should really have to pay for that forever,and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.
SWBD-355,"B: I wish they'd put those, that's why I say, did you stay up late to watch this Red Dwarf. It came on after Doctor Who, on Saturday nights, here at least. A: Uh-huh. B: And it should, of course I li- really it was,",they should show it during prime time,"I don't think they should show it during prime time,"
SWBD-356,"B: Oh, I do too. A: So anyway it's still, B: Uh-huh, uh-huh. ",they should stop her,"And, you know, if she wanted to go to combat, I do not see that they should stop her."
SWBD-357,"B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war.",they were committed to winning the Vietnam War and getting out,I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out
SWBD-358,"B: I'm sorry. B: Well, I'm in Texas. I just assumed that I had, this is the first call I've done, A: Uh-huh. B:",they were going to reach out to people from all over the country,"and, I didn't realize that they were going to reach out to people from, all over the country."
SWBD-359,"B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored. You know, they will allow you to, I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B:",they were in this area,I don't think they're were in this area
SWBD-36,"B: That's right, it's all their fault. A: Well, I mean, it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they saw the light, um, I don't know why they um, were more able than we were",they're just going to start using the things now,"except I think, that they probably just said well, we're just going to start using the things now"
SWBD-360,"B: And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus. It's a really nice car. I think, it's a stylish car both inside and out. It's comfortable to drive. Uh, reasonable performance, and this is out in California where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore. A: Yeah. B: Uh, I've been real impressed with that. Yo-,",they were putting dual air bags in that car now,"and I didn't realize that they were putting dual, uh, air bags in that car now."
SWBD-361,"A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right.",they would have done that,I don't think they would have done that.
SWBD-362,"A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A:",they would want to go where they used to work,"And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know."
SWBD-363,"A: Right or wrong? B: Uh, okay, right or wrong, I don't think we can determine whether we were right or wrong, because, you're having to deal with, again, uh, I think we could have made a different agreement back in the late forties era that would have kept of there. A: Uh-huh. ",they'd signed some type of deal like that,"Uh, you know, I didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that."
SWBD-364,"A: Really. If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic, you know, intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might. B: Yeah. A: I believe in paying my share, and I don't mind, uh, paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to. But I just sometimes feel like I'm being used.",they'll be able to do anything about it,"But, uh, again I don't think we'll be able to do anything about it,"
SWBD-365,"B: And as far as like them, uh, entertaining the rights that they should have. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, we educate them, we feed them, we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again. A: Uh-huh. B:",they're all bad,"I'm not saying they're all bad,"
SWBD-366,"A: Yeah, huh-uh, and especially not in some of these big cities, like in Dallas I mean they've had, they're up in the top five I think of cities that are getting policeman killed in the line of duty and that's really sad. B: it really is. And I mean, they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything. A: Uh-huh. B:",they're all good,"You know, and I'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,"
SWBD-367,"A: Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long. B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that",they're going to be serving somebody,"and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody."
SWBD-368,A: How did Radio Shack work? B: If you go in and buy anything they want your phone number.,they're going to call him,"And I don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning,"
SWBD-369,"A: Right. And, see that's my only problem with, uh, making you, um, you know, get the check and everything is, I guess bad guys, if you want to call them bad guys, they are going to get a gun no matter what. B: Uh-huh. A: They're not,",they're going to go to a gun store,"I don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check,"
SWBD-37,"A: Yes, um, I think that Plano has really done a fantastic job. I mean, at least their plans are good. Um, however, I was,",they've had some problem with the recycling on plastic,"maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, um, they've had some problems with, the recycling on plastic,"
SWBD-370,"B: But, I do n't get into uh, the real women libber movement, you know. A: No, I do n't either.",that they're going to prove that men and women are equal,I do n't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal.
SWBD-371,B: That's it. A: And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything. B: Uh-huh.,they're going to use it too frequently,"Well, right now our laws are so liberal that, uh, even with the death penalty in effect, I do n't think that, uh, they're going to use it, uh, too frequently, uh, unfortunately."
SWBD-372,"B: So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there? A:",they're out of line,"Well, actually, I do n't think they're out of line."
SWBD-373,"A: I do too. I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time, but I don't, I believe that they're better now, you know, wh-, B: I think so.",they're shoddy,I don't think they're shoddy
SWBD-376,"B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good.",they've gone that far,"I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,"
SWBD-377,"B: uh, what kind of camping do they like best? Do they like it where they have tents and, uh, do they cook on stoves? A: Um, yes, they've, well, no, actually I remember, they have taken the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire,",they've taken the stoves,and I don't think they've taken the stoves.
SWBD-378,"A: Well I hadn't either, B: Yeah. A: We hadn't, you know, like I said, we,",they've thought about sending the schedules out,I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet.
SWBD-379,"A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say. I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better. B: I think technology is better, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B:",things are being made better,"I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,"
SWBD-38,"B: That's right. A: Well, that's fun. So, um, let's see, uh, some of the things we do together as a family, we like to play games a lot,",this is funny,"and you may think this is funny,"
SWBD-380,"B: Well, the world changes, so I mean, obviously, kids are not the same now as they used to be. A: Right. B: I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things. They have a whole lot more, uh, variety of things that they see and do at an earlier age, so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time, but still, I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to teach, uh, basic values and basic, uh, respectful uh, -ness of authority. A: Right. B:",this doesn't always get emphasized anymore,"And I just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore, uh,"
SWBD-381,"A: Good morning. Um, I mean, if I start this I just wanted to say that, um, one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are, and I mean they think differently and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours. and right now, I think that that's been proven in the fact that, um, they have just, well, anyway, I just think that, you know, the United States policy over there, I think we should just leave them alone. I really do. in a major way because um, that whole region over there, I think needs to settle its own differences within itself. B: Yeah. A: And that's the course that they should go, I mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,",this intervention at such high levels should be going on,but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on.
SWBD-382,"B: and, you know, they just love kittens. A: Yeah. B: They just are fascinated. A: Oh, yeah. B:",this is a cat,So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet.
SWBD-383,"A: Yeah, but, uh, I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty, uh, innocuous. Although, uh, from what I hear in the news, and I saw an episode of the TV show, COPS uh, one time that was in Pittsburgh, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, it did surprise me, because, you know, they were doing drug arrests and things like that,",those things happen too often,"but I don't really think those things happen too often because, like I said, from what's reported in the news, at least, it's not all that common."
SWBD-384,"B: Oh, you are in New York right now? A: Yeah. B: Oh. I'm in Texas.",this was from all over the whole country,I didn't know this was from all over the whole country.
SWBD-385,B: And it's just too bad that we couldn't see that. A: I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet. That I still feel like there's more to come.,this whole issue is settled,I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned.
SWBD-386,"A: People are always mo-, you know, one out of every seven people moves every year. Uh, that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: if you compound that, uh, eh- eh, if it is difficult to register to vote, that would remove your eligibility to vote. B:",voter registration is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place,"But I do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place, or, who are not just motivated who really believe that their voice is heard."
SWBD-387,"B: and at that point, the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned, and, we were there like in the middle of the summer, it's unair-conditioned, it was dusty and dirty, uh, there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it. And so, we didn't really know we weren't supposed to, we thought TI dress code was just dress appropriate to your job, A: Uh-huh. B: we wore shorts.",wearing shorts was a big no no,"We didn't know that was a big no, no."
SWBD-388,"A: Because, I know that now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles. B: Uh-huh, uh-huh. A: And the only, uh, branch in the armed services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force. And, uh, I spoke because women were flying missions uh, in the Persian Gulf war. B: Huh.  Yeah, yeah. A:",women are capable of doing the job,But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job.
SWBD-389,"A: It was just a side benefit. B: Yeah, yeah, because, I'm not big or anything, but I'm not in great shape, But when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape. I didn't build up muscle, though, I just got real good and toned. A: Yeah. B:",women look good with muscles,I don't think women look good with muscles.

But you know, they live to a hundred and ten some, you know, B: Yeah, A: And, that's, B:",a lot of that is diet  too,"Well, don't you think a lot of that is diet too?"

SWBD-392,"B: and the new cars is, hardly anything. A: Yeah, they're better, but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there. Uh, when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or, uh, B: Yeah,",the trucks are out of tune,but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune.
SWBD-393,"A: that's the whole point. There are so many games in a year that they've got to have repeat customers. B: Yeah. A: They can't afford not to, and, you know, that's one of the things that I think Saint Louis has done, um, I mean, you know, their ticket prices are, you know, I guess as high as anybody else's but somehow or another they, attract, uh, so many people from, I mean it's a small market and yet they attract as many if not more than uh, uh, most, other cities, so.

Well, do you think that should be implemented in the work place",a manager or supervisor should have the right to send someone to be tested,". You know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs, do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested."
SWBD-396,"B: Right. And I'm sure that would make a big difference, too. You know, you've got, A: Yeah. Well, what about a voluntary program?",a voluntary program would be a good idea,Do you think that would be a good idea?

B: you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers,",day care centers are always like a family owned center,"have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it, you know, kind of thing."
SWBD-399,"A: It's no more costly than renting one. The last, see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw FX TWO and that is a really good movie, if you like special effects, kind of gory and lots of, you know action. B: Uh-huh.
