SWBD-170,I don't think I can keep my own garbage.
SWBD-171,"I don't think I can pronounce it either,"
SWBD-172,"Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time,"
SWBD-173,I don't know that I could do that.
SWBD-174,"I mean, I honestly don't really think I could have, you know, done much better than I did in the school system I was in."
SWBD-175,I don't think I could stay home all the time and do nothing.
SWBD-176,I don't think I do either
SWBD-177,and I don't think I had too many nuts and bolts left over when I got it all put back together.
SWBD-178,I don't think I have a philosophical problem with that.
SWBD-179,I don't think I've ever seen one.
SWBD-18,"Oh, I could just see hair would start growing out of my upper lip or something."
SWBD-180,I don't think that I've ever heard of that movie.
SWBD-181,I don't think I've even heard of that show.
SWBD-182,"I don't think I've heard anything on the Rangers,"
SWBD-183,"uh, I don't think I've ever met a type of music I don't like except for, uh, maybe, you know, heavy metal and that."
SWBD-184,"and, uh, I don't think I've ever even been in one."
SWBD-185,"I mean, I don't think I ever see the Little Dipper,"
SWBD-186,I don't think I've ever seen them nationally on basketball.
SWBD-187,I don't think I've ever seen them not look happy.
SWBD-188,"actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in my life to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. TRS Eighty when they first came out."
SWBD-189,"I don't think I'm getting what I should,"
SWBD-19,you could say I'm in Baltimore.
SWBD-190,"because, in my opinion, I don't think I'm ever going to see any of this so-called peace dividend."
SWBD-191,"I don't think I'm in the, uh, majority in Texas"
SWBD-192,and I don't even think I know my number.
SWBD-193,But I don't think I ever see it except when I go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in the mountains.
SWBD-194,"I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons, gymnastics, piano."
SWBD-195,I don't think I want to see that either.
SWBD-196,because I didn't think I was really going to use it.
SWBD-197,I don't think I went to any of them.
SWBD-198,"come to think of it, I don't think I went to the movies one time."
SWBD-199,and I don't think I'll do it again.
SWBD-2,I doubt if they would say it was too long.
SWBD-20,nobody can think that it can't happen to them.
SWBD-200,I still don't think I would blame it directly on the school.
SWBD-201,but I don't think I would do it to my parents personally.
SWBD-202,"and I don't think I'd ever, you know, do that,"
SWBD-203,I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself.
SWBD-204,"I don't think I would have gone on, unless I had that financial uh, easement made possible."
SWBD-205,And I don't think I would have thought about that.
SWBD-206,I don't think I'd like the KGB monitoring my phone or anything like that.
SWBD-207,"and personally, I don't think I would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body."
SWBD-208,and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that
SWBD-209,"and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either."
SWBD-21,maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent.
SWBD-210,", I mean, I don't think they have anything in common,"
SWBD-211,And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective.
SWBD-212,"But, you know, I don't think rugby will ever be professional"
SWBD-213,"Nobody thought she would adjust,"
SWBD-214,She can't accept that we want to be the care givers.
SWBD-215,But I don't know that you could call that invading my privacy
SWBD-216,"I just, uh, don't think that I need them, you know."
SWBD-217,I don't know that I read anything strictly labeled self improvement.
SWBD-218,and I don't feel that I really get a whole lot of return from that.
SWBD-219,"I, I'm not saying that I do either"
SWBD-22,I could swear it was IBM.
SWBD-220,", I mean, I'm not saying I think or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case, you know, especially because there are some cases when you just don't know"
SWBD-221,"and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from,"
SWBD-222,"Well, I do not think I would put her in day care for joint, situation right now, unless it was like one other child with a person."
SWBD-223,"The more I verbalize it, I do not think I would want to change the system."
SWBD-224,"even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that, I sort of want to defend an employer's rights uh, in addition to an individual's rights,"
SWBD-225,I don't think I'd know where to start with a diesel.
SWBD-226,"Oh, I didn't hear that was coming out."
SWBD-227,"But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked."
SWBD-228,"Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there."
SWBD-229,"But, there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting."
SWBD-23,"now I think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because, uh, they have these, uh, sort of, -tory tests you have to take before you get a diploma."
SWBD-230,I don't think anybody pays too little.
SWBD-231,"and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently"
SWBD-232,He didn't believe anybody would believe that.
SWBD-233,"I don't think anybody around here would understand all those exotic techniques, you know, getting rid of the heavy metals."
SWBD-234,"and I don't think anybody in my house knows the difference, unless you tell them."
SWBD-235,I don't really think anything's been broken.
SWBD-236,I guess I'm to the point where I'm cynical enough that I really don't believe anything will happen unless there's something economically justifiable about it.
SWBD-237,I don't think anything will ever take over the NFL.
SWBD-238,"Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it."
SWBD-239,"Well, I just don't think you can go wrong with something like that."
SWBD-24,And I could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever.
SWBD-240,they don't know that I don't use drugs.
SWBD-241,"when you said it was quite a way away, I did not know that meant you had to drive like an hour"
SWBD-242,"I don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving, you know,"
SWBD-243,"I don't know uh, that I'd trade my dog in for the world."
SWBD-244,That's pretty interesting just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it.
SWBD-245,"I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that,"
SWBD-246,"I don't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything,"
SWBD-247,"I don't know that I, uh, felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs."
SWBD-248,And I don't think she's ever touched it you know.
SWBD-249,I don't think student teaching is enough.
SWBD-25,"And well, I guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools."
SWBD-250,I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.
SWBD-251,I didn't know it did that.
SWBD-252,I've never seen taxes really go down.
SWBD-253,I don't know that it does.
SWBD-254,"And their program they had, I don't think had a lot of, uh, problems associated with it,"
SWBD-255,but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.
SWBD-256,I don't think that's going to work.
SWBD-257,"and, uh, I don't know that that looks that bad."
SWBD-258,"and you know, I didn't think that one was near as good."
SWBD-259,"and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're, uh, kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this, uh, throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies."
SWBD-26,"you might say I'm, uh, uh, good back yard mechanic"
SWBD-260,"So, you know, I don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families"
SWBD-261,"Uh, I didn't think that was a new revelation."
SWBD-262,"But, I didn't think that was as good. Because, it was like, you know, you couldn't really talk and stuff, like you could when, you were at the lake, or somewhere, you know, where you were out."
SWBD-263,"And then, I didn't think that was right, because he may have been a good president, or whatever."
SWBD-264,I didn't think that was any good
SWBD-265,But I didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water.
SWBD-266,I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in.
SWBD-267,"Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all."
SWBD-268,"I don't know that that would work if, somebody's, didn't really want to be there and didn't have,"
SWBD-269,"uh, but, I don't think that's done much anywhere."
SWBD-27,"and a lot of bosses may say I'm nuts,"
SWBD-270,I didn't even know they had anything like that.
SWBD-271,"I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage."
SWBD-272,I've never seen the Astros play.
SWBD-273,I don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America
SWBD-274,"And, uh, uh, granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it, but it,"
SWBD-275,I don't think the Cowboys have got a chance.
SWBD-276,"and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car."
SWBD-277,"he doesn't know that he's tearing up things,"
SWBD-278,I don't think the general audience would go for it.
SWBD-279,"like I say, I don't think the guy who's going to rob a Seven Eleven, is going to rob a Seven Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife, baseball bat, or, you know, whatever,"
SWBD-28,You might even find somebody's been reporting on you
SWBD-280,I don't think the higher ups were thinking about what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine.
SWBD-281,I did not know the hyacinths were going to die.
SWBD-282,I don't think the judge should just make the decision alone.
SWBD-283,I don't think the jury should be the ones that put the sentencings down.
SWBD-284,"so you know, these parents didn't know the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming, let me in."
SWBD-285,"and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,"
SWBD-286,"I don't think, you know, the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars, and this type of thing."
SWBD-287,"I mean, I don't think that law will ever change."
SWBD-288,I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way
SWBD-289,and again I don't think the Peace Corps is as successful now simply because it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore.
SWBD-29,"You know, I mean you might think you're paying something on time"
SWBD-290,"Uh, and, you know, it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. Uh, for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because I honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible, you know, really care."
SWBD-291,"I think there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their, uh, opinion is going to be heard"
SWBD-292,"the police, I don't think can do it alone, you know."
SWBD-293,"but, uh, I don't think the rich are paying not enough,"
SWBD-294,they don't even know they are there. You know.
SWBD-295,and I really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore.
SWBD-296,"Well, I don't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world."
SWBD-297,because I don't think the system is going to get fixed.
SWBD-298,but I don't think the teachers could stand the stress all year long frankly.
SWBD-299,"Well, that's odd because I don't think the teachers in my school district, uh, were well paid."
SWBD-3,"and if I had thought I, uh, wanted to pay the amount of money, I probably would have gone with, uh, uh, an Accord or even a Civic, or something comparable from Nissan or Toyota,"
SWBD-30,"I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the worst thing that's happening at least the modern world today, is television."
SWBD-300,And I don't think the US will stand for it.
SWBD-301,I don't think that the way I get the news is the right way to get it.
SWBD-302,"And, uh, you know, I don't know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing."
SWBD-303,But I didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed.
SWBD-304,"I don't know that their job would be at risk,"
SWBD-305,I don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind.
SWBD-306,I don't think there can be anymore long range planning.
SWBD-307,So I don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news.
SWBD-308,"Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem"
SWBD-309,"I don't know that there is an easy solution,"
SWBD-31,"just by looking at him and the way he acted, you could tell he was in need of nursing home care,"
SWBD-310,I don't think that there is enough being done.
SWBD-311,"I don't think there is any such thing, as a crime free zone any longer."
SWBD-312,I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.
SWBD-313,"Since I am a law-abiding citizen and I have never had a felony, if I wanted to buy one, I don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it."
SWBD-314,see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie.
SWBD-315,"I don't think there was. Um,"
SWBD-316,"And I think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them,"
SWBD-317,I didn't know there were such things.
SWBD-318,"So, I don't think there will be too much problem"
SWBD-319,I don't think there would be too many left.
SWBD-32,"I suppose, uh, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another,"
SWBD-320,"but, uh, I guess these people that go around and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse, uh, I don't think they deserve to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives."
SWBD-321,"I mean I've never seen them do it without hose,"
SWBD-322,"I don't think they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I didn't, I mean,"
SWBD-323,So I really don't think they can really do much of anything to change it.
SWBD-324,I didn't know they did it long distance.
SWBD-325,"and when I painted them, I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house."
SWBD-326,"I don't think they do the packaging at this plant,"
SWBD-327,"I don't understand that, they don't want to be with anybody else."
SWBD-328,I don't think that they educate them enough to really know what's going on.
SWBD-329,"I don't think they even realize what's out there, and to what extent."
SWBD-33,"uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and bred them."
SWBD-330,and I don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house.
SWBD-331,and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either.
SWBD-332,and I do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there. Which is a shame
SWBD-333,"But, I don't think we gained any weight from it"
SWBD-334,"Oh, you don't think they got the codes from the US already?"
SWBD-335,but I didn't know they had a four eighty-six just yet.
SWBD-336,but I didn't know that they had been watching me
SWBD-337,"But you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything, and take it out on the school."
SWBD-338,"I don't think they have a whole lot to say, even."
SWBD-339,"Well, my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them."
SWBD-34,"Um, but I thought I saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using"
SWBD-340,I don't even think we have that in Texas.
SWBD-341,I don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet.
SWBD-342,And I do not think they have seen a really high improvement.
SWBD-343,I don't think they have that on anymore.
SWBD-344,"but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children."
SWBD-345,"but I just don't think they have the resources, if you were to compare, uh, the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or Fax machines and cellular phones, and state of the art equipment that we are so used to."
SWBD-346,I don't think they have the right to do that.
SWBD-347,I don't think they like the fact that I have one either.
SWBD-348,and I don't think we did it.
SWBD-349,I'm not saying they read all the right things
SWBD-35,"but for me the thing that strikes me is uh, growing up in rural South Dakota where, hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery would candle them and package them is that, uh, in the fifties, uh, you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now. Which was all the milk bottles were glass"
SWBD-350,"I don't think they really cared about the answer,"
SWBD-351,"Uh, I don't think they should abolish it."
SWBD-352,"Like for theft and stuff like that or manslaughter, you know, I don't think they should do that."
SWBD-353,"and I don't necessarily think that they should, uh, fund AIDS research and, in the process, neglect cancer research or whatever."
SWBD-354,and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.
SWBD-355,"I don't think they should show it during prime time,"
SWBD-356,"And, you know, if she wanted to go to combat, I do not see that they should stop her."
SWBD-357,I don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out
SWBD-358,"and, I didn't realize that they were going to reach out to people from, all over the country."
SWBD-359,I don't think they're were in this area
SWBD-36,"except I think, that they probably just said well, we're just going to start using the things now"
SWBD-360,"and I didn't realize that they were putting dual, uh, air bags in that car now."
SWBD-361,I don't think they would have done that.
SWBD-362,"And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know."
SWBD-363,"Uh, you know, I didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that."
SWBD-364,"But, uh, again I don't think we'll be able to do anything about it,"
SWBD-365,"I'm not saying they're all bad,"
SWBD-366,"You know, and I'm not saying that they're all good either, because there's good and bad in everything,"
SWBD-367,"and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place, I don't think that they're going to be serving anybody."
SWBD-368,"And I don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning,"
SWBD-369,"I don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check,"
SWBD-37,"maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, um, they've had some problems with, the recycling on plastic,"
SWBD-370,I do n't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal.
SWBD-371,"Well, right now our laws are so liberal that, uh, even with the death penalty in effect, I do n't think that, uh, they're going to use it, uh, too frequently, uh, unfortunately."
SWBD-372,"Well, actually, I do n't think they're out of line."
SWBD-373,I don't think they're shoddy
SWBD-376,"I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it,"
SWBD-377,and I don't think they've taken the stoves.
SWBD-378,I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet.
SWBD-379,"I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,"
SWBD-38,"and you may think this is funny,"
SWBD-380,"And I just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore, uh,"
SWBD-381,but I don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on.
SWBD-382,So she doesn't know that this is a cat yet.
SWBD-383,"but I don't really think those things happen too often because, like I said, from what's reported in the news, at least, it's not all that common."
SWBD-384,I didn't know this was from all over the whole country.
SWBD-385,I don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned.
SWBD-386,"But I do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place, or, who are not just motivated who really believe that their voice is heard."
SWBD-387,"We didn't know that was a big no, no."
SWBD-388,But I know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job.
SWBD-389,I don't think women look good with muscles.
SWBD-39,"I said if Tom could see dog lick this kitty, he'd flip."
SWBD-390,"Well, don't you think a lot of that is diet too?"
SWBD-391,"Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?"
SWBD-392,but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune.
SWBD-393,but don't you think there are older fans there.
SWBD-394,"I don't think they've ever made a movie, do you?"
SWBD-395,". You know, as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs, do you think they should have the right to send them to be tested."
SWBD-396,Do you think that would be a good idea?
SWBD-397,Do you think D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more.
SWBD-398,"have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it, you know, kind of thing."
SWBD-399,"Um, do you know that I don't follow performers,"
SWBD-4,"And if they know some practice is wrong, you know,"
SWBD-40,"the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury,"
SWBD-400,You think my daughter would like it?
SWBD-401,do you know my grandparents live in Durant?
SWBD-402,do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard?
SWBD-403,"Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this"
SWBD-404,"do you feel it will swing back the other way,"
SWBD-405,"You know, I think it's kind of coming back around to that, don't you,"
SWBD-406,"And did you know John Sununu is, uh, half Arab?"
SWBD-408,"um, or do you hypothesize that most of the, uh, smog or air pollution comes from vehicles"
SWBD-409,Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.
SWBD-41,"I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again."
SWBD-410,"uh, do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from, uh, industrial areas, factories and so on?"
SWBD-411,"Well, uh, do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote?"
SWBD-412,"Do you think he won from Carter because of um, the hostages that were held at that time?"
SWBD-413,do you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas.
SWBD-414,"Well, now, do you find that security is very good in a town home?"
SWBD-415,"Oh, I bet it doesn't mix well, does it?"
SWBD-416,"Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term?"
SWBD-417,"Uh, do you feel that yours is invaded?"
SWBD-418,"Do you find you do most of your, uh, crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time?"
SWBD-419,"So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers uh, will win"
SWBD-42,"you know, that I just couldn't believe that he got voted out."
SWBD-420,do you find you use it a lot?
SWBD-421,and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you.
SWBD-422,Do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools?
SWBD-423,"you think you'd, uh, go up in space if you had a chance?"
SWBD-424,"I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high. if I am not mistaken, aren't they?"
SWBD-425,"I guess that is your standard knitting, isn't it?"
SWBD-426,"Well, do you think that should be implemented in the work place"
SWBD-427,do you think that would be reasonable?
SWBD-428,"I think it went to Lockheed, didn't it?"
SWBD-429,"did you think that well, the Gulf War coverage would be kind of, uh, an abnormality?"
SWBD-43,"Just, it is, I would not say it is not as bad as New York,"
SWBD-430,"Do you think that the individual has as much time as they did, let's say, ten, twenty years ago?"
SWBD-431,"Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts?"
SWBD-432,do you think that should be changed?
