BNC-1,Polly had to think quickly.
BNC-1002,"Nevertheless, life went on as it always does. By the accidents of distance and dates of birth both the Kiwi Keith and the Mackenzie houses had been spared the effects of war and neither knew the pain of loss or the sadness of wounds in young bodies."
BNC-1003,"He patted her hand. If he had chosen to, Thomas might have told her in no uncertain terms what was wrong."
BNC-1005,"She could see his distorted image in the slanted glass of the car's windows, dim in the background, still lit by his instruments. She wondered how she could ever have thought that she loved him, and why she had stayed with him for so long after she 'd realised that if she ever had, she did not love him now."
BNC-1006,"She glanced around the room, laying her hot flushed face against the cool pillow, listening to the bang of a cupboard door below, the chinks of crockery. The room seemed empty without him, strange and unfriendly."
BNC-1010,"In the clenched-to-cracking night We mouthed the hope, gave it a name: twenty-sixty-two still trembles in the flinching air and catches, bright rag on a bramble. At supper earlier the three of us had talked of Californian scientists who see the foetal heart accelerate translucent fingers tense and eye-muscles steer frantically through their dark when sounds of a high-revving motor are played to swelling, quizzically-smiling moms and wondered if there's anywhere on earth-Australasia or Amazonian forest-to find an unborn innocent of engines."
BNC-1012,"Dynmouth was becoming a nasty kind of place.'' Poor Miss Poraway,'' Quentin said as they washed the tea dishes, and Lavinia - not feeling agreeably disposed towards Miss Poraway - did not say anything."
BNC-1014,Stan was running a business and needed funds to buy stock and time to work on new finds. The price proposed was on the open market and Stuttgart was happy to offer it.
BNC-1015,It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down.
BNC-1018,"Some would say her hair is her finest feature, though Robyn herself secretly hankers after something more muted and malleable, hair that could be groomed and styled according to mood - drawn back in a severe bun like Simone de Beauvoir's, or allowed to fall to the shoulders in a Pre-Raphaelite cloud. As it is, there is not much she can do with her curls except, every now and again, crop them brutally short just to demonstrate how inadequately they represent her character."
BNC-1019,"Hardly, thought Jaq. Nor could Obispal exactly be viewed as incompetent, despite his last-moment slackening of judgement when he charged into that trap in the arcade."
BNC-1020,"Perhaps I should apologize for my tears. As a rationalist, I had but to snap my rational fingers, it might be argued, and the devil would fade away in a puff of smoke."
BNC-1024,"It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies."
BNC-1031,He looked at me questioningly.
BNC-1032,"The kitchen radiator doesn't work and the Calorgas fire hadn't warmed the place up yet. I began to wonder about how long hypothermia takes to kill someone, I mean what if I left Mum there overnight - would that be long enough?"
BNC-1035,At this rate I 'll be a Homelessness Statistic. A student!
BNC-1046,"The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased."
BNC-1047,Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.
BNC-1048,"That day it all came out. Constanza tried to follow her out of the hotel-as she was very very upset, my grandmother-but Constanza was too late."
BNC-1049,"Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it."
BNC-1055,When Matt married Inez I was left high and dry. A year later I met a sales rep for an agricultural firm and married him.
BNC-106,She spoke - more slowly than she had spoken before - and Fatima listened with a concentrated intensity that she never lent to Marie Claire's requests and detailed instructions. It was evident in all their dealings that no matter how Marie Claire bestirred herself the maids would do things as they had always done them.
BNC-1063,"Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer."
BNC-1066,I should think that just about everyone was having a go at everyone else by the time it ended.
BNC-1068,"Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench."
BNC-1069,The car engine roared again and the red car moved off but it didn't go far. Stuart's Mum was reversing out of her space and her car was blocking the way.
BNC-107,Harvey thinks very highly of you and you 'll be a great comfort to him. Terrible way for young Judd to die.
BNC-1070,"He opened the door and smiled because a good-looking woman was arriving to keep a date. Sophie sat down at Pascoe's table and said, ``I thought I 'd find you here.''"
BNC-1071,"But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind."
BNC-1074,Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously.
BNC-1075,"They were all the same, all noise and sparrow shit, and if the man only knew the idiot scene he cut... ``My fire exploded.'' The fight had fled the Major."
BNC-1077,"Roman settled them at one of the small tables in a garden at the side of the yard at the Crowned Head. He summoned a girl, who seemed mesmerised by his virile look, and ordered lager for them both."
BNC-1080,"``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department."
BNC-1082,Or Alexandra? He rather thought not.
BNC-1083,The women were much easier to supervise and hold. So he refused to accept Dule in exchange.
BNC-1086,``Do you mind if I use your phone?''
BNC-1087,"It grew bigger with incredible speed, she was whizzing towards it. She must slow down or she 'd miss it."
BNC-1089,"``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.''"
BNC-1091,"Alone in the big drawing-room where Annette's choice of bright fabrics had fought hardest, albeit still without winning against her dead in-laws ' passion for darkpanelled gloom Maxim went straight to the telephone. It was the same old-fashioned type as Miss Tuckey's and he unscrewed the mouthpiece carefully but found nothing extra inside."
BNC-1092,"``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?''"
BNC-1093,The other set being in the pocket of Giovanna's overall from which she now drew them and held them up making it clear that they would be relinquished only upon her death and then only into the hands of Signor Kettering. What had occurred was quite contrary to the wishes of the padrone who would be outraged if he ever got to hear of it.
BNC-1094,"He spoke Maa fluently and he had unrivalled connections. As women do, she probably knew that she had made an impression on him on the two or three occasions they had met at Muthaiga."
BNC-1095,"It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night."
BNC-1099,"Biddy was right. In London, I did some serious thinking."
BNC-1100,It was dark and well stormy by the time I got to the Aurora Corona Rest Home and the residents were probably battened down for the night. I parked Armstrong on the road and walked down the short drive to the impressive Gothic porch around the front door.
BNC-1101,"And if anyone had noticed, maybe I could have just tossed the whole matter off in a casual way. ``Oh, that... it's nothing much...'' No, it's too easy to forget that something which I hardly ever think about now was then a very great concern."
BNC-1102,"During that pause I realized that Mala had not been offered a seat, nor any food or drink. The Emissary and his people were behaving as if she simply wasn't there."
BNC-1106,``I think he ought to know about this.'' The ex-soldier said and started to rise.
BNC-1111,"She was pouring a cup of tea when the solution came to her. As a member of the editorial collective of Fem Sap, it was part of her job to commission occasional articles."
BNC-1114,"We saw him at the Test matches, congratulating Gooch. But we never really believed that John Major was a sports fan until we saw him on that bleak Sunday afternoon at Stamford Bridge."
BNC-1116,"Emily - she seemed to be her own mistress, despite the grand connections - would surely not refuse an honest offer. Yet he was not, at present, in a position to make one."
BNC-1121,"He came up with them to Four on the first floor, Tom's room. This irritated Alice."
BNC-1122,"She had had very little to do with Bunny, but on their occasional meetings the girl had grown more civil of late."
BNC-1123,It seems the fellow carried out his task well enough - there are two corpses in the burial chest this morning. But who could say for certain?
BNC-1124,"Manville had pruned Hayman's original shortlist of five to just two names, and added a third of his own choosing from the original dossier."
BNC-1127,"He would come when he would come, and the Tabula Rasa would have to bide its time, though the longer he was away the more the likelihood grew of one of their number voicing the suspicion some of them surely nurtured. That Godolphin's dealings in talismans and wantons were only the tip of the iceberg."
BNC-1129,And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say?
BNC-1130,"He was engaging in a war of nerves with her, Isabel realised at last, but he didn't remember. She stared back at him, unable to speak, terrified of betraying the slightest clue that might jolt his memory, but conscious of a heartfelt sense of gratitude for the fever that had kept her so busy during the morning hours."
BNC-1131,"She was not constructed to be attractive. Roland half wished that she was, that a merchant banker would take her out to dinner, or a shady solicitor to the Playboy Club."
BNC-1132,Ginny could only suppose that Ralph thought he was protecting her from a possible nuisance. Perhaps he thought British Council employees who received personal calls at work were instantly dismissed.
BNC-1133,Still missing. Found dead.
BNC-1134,"Trazior did overlook such a desert, as southerly sentinel of the Palatine cluster. However, Trazior also formed part of a mega-complex of hives densely crowding a poisoned terrain, interlinked by transport tubes supported on pylons or suspended from cables."
BNC-1135,"``One of the old school,'' Ramsbum kept intoning. ``God knows what'll happen to us now.''"
BNC-1136,"``If I tread too presumptuously into sacred places, reprove me,'' entreated the earl, with the submissive sweetness of a brand-new novice. Precious little chance of that happening, thought Hugh, listening and observing with a pleasure that recalled to mind some of his earliest and most tentative exchanges with Brother Cadfael, dealing trick for trick and dart for dart, and feeling their way over small battlefields to a lasting friendship."
BNC-1137,"It sounded plausible, but the words were a little too pat for Lorton's liking. The solution was so convenient - and for someone in Tolby's position so tactful too."
BNC-1141,"``Otherwise I shall faint.'' Though the window on the stairwell was left on the latch there was always a peculiar smell in the room, a mixture of coke fumes from the hot-water pipes, peppermints and that pervasive mist of eau de Cologne sprayed so recklessly by Dawn Allenby."
BNC-1142,"``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!''"
BNC-1144,"``That's no problem,'' he grinned, unabashed. ``We have a perfectly efficient paging system, isn't that right, Niall?''"
BNC-1145,She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde.
BNC-1146,"David had obviously always known and Julia had learned that, whatever feelings were churning around inside his mother's mind, it was vital for her that they remained private. David was holding the strings in a pattern Julia had never seen before."
BNC-1147,"She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way."
BNC-1148,"I'm such a coward, I hear things that aren't there. She set her lips and dragged Adam out of the fire, hooking one of his arms round her neck."
BNC-1150,"Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark."
BNC-1154,"The Colonel could tell that the noise was distracting Amanda from her pamphlet, though she gave no outward sign. It was simply that he could judge such things after living so closely with her for however many years."
BNC-1158,"Nick rolled his eyes upwards. ``Not so bad, then.''"
BNC-1159,Louise was equally anxious to see this man who had had the power to persuade her niece to go against her upbringing and character and behave so recklessly after such a brief acquaintance. Waiting in the airport she was suddenly aware of Nora striding towards her.
BNC-116,"After all, they had been together for a couple of years and she did idolise him. A line cut between Ashley's brows."
BNC-1160,``Yes?'' ``Nathan?''
BNC-1163,Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement.
BNC-1164,"It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road."
BNC-1166,"Zenaida the sorceress jumped on her from behind, one hand at her throat, the other yanking at her hair."
BNC-1169,"I didn't say anything, but kept on eating slowly."
BNC-1173,"Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot."
BNC-1180,"Dam the leaks? If I do that, the Company doesn't have to know I've been interfacing data when I shouldn't."
BNC-1185,"Except that his face, with those tobacco-stained looking eyes and drooping moustache, was always the same and you never knew what he was thinking. When he looked at you it was like he knew something he wasn't telling, or was laughing at you, no matter what it was he said."
BNC-1187,"I worried about the mythic trees you used to paint. Outside, some kids, browned off with the phone-booth, had snapped a sapling rowan in half."
BNC-119,"It's true - Peter can be infuriating, she registered. And, to someone with Marc's undoubted ambition and sheer grit, he probably seems hopelessly in need of a helping hand."
BNC-1194,"And if he knew why did he tell her and annoy her still further? If he did have designs on her, and a plan to marry Mr Eddie Hogan's daughter and thereby marry into the business, then why was he saying all the things that would irritate and upset her?"
BNC-120,"We must be well past Malmesbury by this time, Isabel thought. But the fortress there was an outpost, virtually surrounded by enemy castles."
BNC-1200,"Mrs Menzies had died five years before, killed by malaria and stomach trouble from their time in Bengal. Menzies himself had a yellow face with a stained-looking flush on each cheekbone, and when he felt a bout of fever coming on, he drank to drown the symptoms."
BNC-1201,"Right then Shannon would gladly have given her entire make-up kit for a rest, but there was no way she was about to admit any weakness to him, particularly after that crack about her ``poor over-used mouth''. So he thought she talked too much, did he?"
BNC-1205,"Still doubtful, the embalmer beckoned his assistants away from their other tasks."
BNC-1208,"It is obvious, is it not, that if one gets emotionally involved in a problem, one can not perform as well as when one is viewing it impersonally, yes?'' ``Yes,'' Fabia agreed, but what was more than obvious to her, with Ven stressing, ``specifically'' stressing, that Lubor talk to her on an impersonal basis only, was that he still didn't trust her not to ask personal questions about him."
BNC-1211,She gazed at him through her thick lashes.
BNC-1213,It was ridiculously easy to get away and her own skill brought a grin to her face. The great Felipe had not even been around and the servants had ignored the fact that the inglesa was calmly walking towards the great gates.
BNC-1217,"For a moment Leith wondered who the dickens he thought she had with her, then she remembered Naylor had been with her last night when Travis had called."
BNC-122,"And how deeply she wished she could feel the confidence impressed upon her voice as she added with forced lightness, ``Apart from any other consideration, I still have a wet dog to find.'' Unconvinced, shaking her grey curls under the mob-cap, Mrs Tillotson did as she was bidden."
BNC-1221,But this was different. Mother Clare's idea of covering obligations centred around the kitchen.
BNC-1223,"His head sank so low that his collar dented his bottom lip, and Sarah had touched his arm in sympathy, earning an even stronger rebuke herself. Nahum was becoming a feverishly energetic lover."
BNC-1224,"However did people manage to discipline themselves and stick to a single line for long enough to gain control, to come out on top, to become the boss instead of the employee? At Liz's party, last night, there had been bosses."
BNC-1228,"Harrison knew many of the wrestlers and the rest of the morning passed pleasantly enough as he moved around the quacks and the pedlars, tinkers and gypsies and show people who were an enjoyable contrast to the farmers ' wives selling their freshly imprinted butter, with their buckets of eggs, the vegetables and poultry, rabbits, game pies, potted char, rum butter. A few of the men had taken a rare day off from the quarries and the recognitions were more generous than Harrison had anticipated."
BNC-1229,"His reaction on seeing them was a surprise to himself, and a shock to them. He soared higher to lure them up and then folding his wings back stooped down towards them, gaining speed with each second and transfixing the weakest-looking one with his stare."
BNC-1236,Those people... Not a one of them realized I was not human. They looked at me and they pretend I'm someone called Franz Kafka.
BNC-1240,How Robert (at Marlborough) patronizes him now. He never talked to me about them.
BNC-1242,"He had been almost tempted to buy some from her at a discount until he remembered her prices. Highgate Cemetery was more or less on his way to the theatre, and although it was almost all old graves without flowers, he had seen some being left regularly by some nutty Communist at the grave of Karl Marx."
BNC-1246,"Even Pedro, pattering nervily about the room, seemed more restless than usual, and when he slept his dreams were troubled. Gradually Louisa began to wonder whether her father had been right after all, whether she had been as unwise as he claimed to shut herself away in this sequestered place."
BNC-1252,"He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do."
BNC-1253,It was mainly to make a good impression on the new tribe. Little Krishna ran off into the jungle.
BNC-1254,"Isabel watched him vanish beneath the barbican and felt as though she had been abandoned to face the enemy without weapons or protection. The shield of cold indifference, the sword of anger, had both been snatched from her by Ralf's warning."
BNC-1256,"Lewis, sensibly, had allowed himself a lot of time. Adam would be very surprised to see him."
BNC-1257,"``I 'd have done it long ago. Now, give me some beer, and don't poison it.''"
BNC-1259,"I felt I had to make him happy after all the sad things which had happened to him, so I told him his English was very good. It was just average really."
BNC-1264,"But I still wasn't sure why. Perhaps it was Nassim's mention of the baby that sparked me off, however subconsciously."
BNC-1273,Then I knew what had happened. He didn't have to tell me the rest.
BNC-1277,"Then a man at the back of the hall began to clap, and someone else joined in. Soon the clapping became fierce applause."
BNC-128,``But it could have been a big jet. Maybe hundreds of passengers.''
BNC-1283,"The guy with her I 'd never seen before. He was shortish and wiry, had a straight thin moustache and I guessed he was anywhere between 40 and 45."
BNC-1285,"No, my dear, you are just as tired as I am, and I shall rest presently in the dressing-room where I have made up a bed for myself. If I leave the door open I shall be able to hear him if his condition worsens."
BNC-1291,The name Northcliffe was linked with raising equity on all five continents but not in such a conspicuous way that he himself garnered personal publicity. I never saw a photograph of him published.
BNC-1292,"The shadow was in the form of a vast spaceship resting near ours, and the last thing it looked was shadowy. The surface was gleaming with pure white and even purer gold."
BNC-1294,I looked at the mouth of the mother of the girl whose mouth I couldn't get enough of kissing. I looked and I looked.
BNC-1295,"That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all."
BNC-1297,But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery.
BNC-1305,I asked him in for a break. I liked that about him.
BNC-1309,"Dorothea had once tried to tell her this, but Alida Thorne had flushed with anger. ``Stop patronising me,'' she had shouted, ``stop pitying me!''"
BNC-1315,"``The motor was running earlier, smooth as honey.'' Lissa accepted the comfort of his assurances."
BNC-1317,``The white man has blood. That is true.''
BNC-1322,Some of them will use their votes judiciously in order to bring about whichever outcome it is they seek. The defeat of the John Major government.
BNC-1323,"He's got a bee in his bonnet about keeping them out of remand homes and prison. I'm not against that, but you can't leave young thugs loose to go round terrorising honest folk."
BNC-1324,"Alice asked after her daughter, Mungo's mother, and complained about the price of bread. She spoke of the pain in her hands, neighbours who had passed on, and twice asked Mungo what school he was going to now."
BNC-1335,"I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing."
BNC-1348,"But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo."
BNC-1351,"The answer is no, no no. Not now, not ever."
BNC-1360,"I can't take it. They keep questioning me, always asking where I was what I did why I did it, did all of them where I was who I was with who am I trying to kid why don't I just admit I did it well if I didn't do all these things, who did?"
BNC-1367,"He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch."
BNC-1373,``Knock once and enter.'' Julia could think of no appropriate reply.
BNC-1374,``What had you in mind to pursue him for?'' ``What you should want to pursue him for might be different from what I would pursue him for.''
BNC-1375,Fenna had become too powerful. Maggie did not want to be a crazy person.
BNC-1376,Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood.
BNC-1380,"I saw the American woman kiss his hand. So she was an RC, too."
BNC-1388,"I have realised all this Quincx. I wouldn't want to embarrass you, but I really can see no alternative at present."
BNC-139,She produced another scroll. ``I have here a petition and I want you all to sign it to show those men in power that the women and children of this country think that slavery is wicked and wrong!''
BNC-1399,"Why should a boat be less social than a caravan, for heaven's sake? He 'd never seen Janet drinking out of a can before, either."
BNC-140,Not rhyming is easier than rhyming. I don't mean art should be as clear as the instructions on a packet of seeds.
BNC-1401,"Then he grilled the result on a flat stone beside the fire. Thus provisioned, he invited Louise to come to the banqueting hall to celebrate her birthday, though in a very quiet way, he assured her."
BNC-1404,"It was an extraordinary sensation, floating here in the inky darkness, with moonbeams dancing off the top of the small waves, and the twinkling stars above shining through the moth-eaten blanket of the night sky. It was as if she was all alone - a tiny speck on the ocean, surrounded by a galaxy that seemed to stretch out into infinity."
BNC-1408,"Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it."
BNC-141,"Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance."
BNC-1411,``I 've already got money that I 've saved from Grye's winnings.'' Seb did not amplify his statement.
BNC-1412,"They were baroque symbols reinforcing the lush imagination of the theatre. But the drama on its own wasn't enough, or great performances, or symbols."
BNC-1430,"Melanie, after a while, began to notch off the weeks in her mind by the appearance of the green-banded china, ``Here comes another Sunday.'' And on Monday mornings, she would look at the little bridge on her willow pattern plate and wish she could run across it away from her Uncle Philip's house to where the flowering trees were."
BNC-1431,"His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face."
BNC-1434,"She felt quite shaky. It had happened before, last night and yesterday morning."
BNC-1438,"They stood in silence, while the sun dipped in the west. And Ruth felt she hadn't understood till now what it meant, to be Jake's daughter."
BNC-1443,She was still trying to cope with the matter when Oliver said they ought to leave if they were to meet him as planned. On the way they stopped for Rain to buy a silk scarf which complemented her blouse.
BNC-1449,"I want to look dark and menacing. The way I ought to look, the way I should look, the way I might have looked if I hadn't had my little accident."
BNC-1450,The English read: It is forbidden to cross the Toacks. That summer I came to know the Toacks - with their roots hooked under the earth's crust.
BNC-1453,The kind of questions Benny never thought to ask but was always interested in the answers. She had never known that her parents met at a tennis party in a county far away.
BNC-1458,``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie.
BNC-1463,"She wanted to run her fingers through his hair, wanted to nuzzle her nose and chin into his neck, wanted to know the texture of his cheek and jaw, wanted to kiss him so that her lips never forgot the shape of his. Then she found she was doing all this already, and a sigh of utter contentment shivered through her."
BNC-1464,"Why should I think that? It's your first time on a horse, for Pete's sake."
BNC-1466,"``You will see the house, child. You will see where he lived and worked and then we will discuss the future,'' Marguerite said with a finality that left Jenna astonished."
BNC-1467,Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience.
BNC-1468,"``Don't think I'm going to pluck it and cook it,'' said Betty. ``If you're going to eat it you 'll have to do it all yourself.''"
BNC-1472,"``You speak calmly, but I know you're suffering.'' ``You are original,'' he said, looking surprised."
BNC-1473,"Juliet drew in her breath as she gazed at it. She had always imagined Nigel's home to be large, but this was immense!"
BNC-1474,"Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion."
BNC-1475,"Had Nigel noticed she 'd left, or hadn't he missed her at all? If he had been aware that she 'd gone, he would probably have assumed that someone else had taken her home."
BNC-149,``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.''
BNC-1498,"``He's harmless, quite afraid of me.'' It brought a very visible relaxing of attitudes that quite surprised Maggie."
BNC-1499,"For Syl I felt no sympathy, since if he was fool enough to want me he deserved none. In the course of time I would die and then it would all be over."
BNC-15,"He hadn't recognised the ageing, twisted features of Pat Weaver, as the man on the bike had cycled lazily past. Nor had the CI5 man who was trailing Stone... Minutes before, as Stone had slipped surreptitiously from his house, his furtive movement had been picked up by Dan Monteith, stationed at the front of the house, concealed in a neighbouring garden."
BNC-1500,She hated to think of his sister lying in hospital waiting for her husband to come to her while all the time he was with Dana. She gripped her hands tightly together.
BNC-1502,I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event.
BNC-1507,"And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention."
BNC-1508,"They pretended that what was happening was not happening, and if it were to happen, it would certainly never happen to the likes of them. ``It is wise to bear in mind how vastly superior is the individual over all the political institutions and social mechanisms which oppress him!''"
BNC-1512,"Tess used to rest her head on the cow's body, her eyes fixed on a distant field. The sun shone on the beautiful lines of her face."
BNC-1519,"He swam away and Adam swam away and very soon after that they came out of the lake and went back to Mary on the terrace. A disturbing experience it had been, exciting and confusing."
BNC-1524,Only Mr Jemps accepted. Red lit one for himself.
BNC-1526,"But in the end I saw that Frejji was right - that Mala and I could probably stay unrecognized in the midst of a typical Uulaan carnival. And there were a couple of other things, I told myself reassuringly, that to tip the balance back a little towards our side."
BNC-1528,"She thought that he 'd not started to drink, but might at any moment. ``Tea's better for you than that stuff,'' she said pertly, as pert as the chit Angela Macleod had called her."
BNC-1529,"He turned his horse time and again, and went ploughing through the thickest of the struggle with bared sword, exchanging strokes with any who cared to stand and debate with him. Time did not exist for him now, as long as any challenged him."
BNC-1530,"Her heart leaped into her mouth, and she paused. It was one thing imagining the scene from the comfort of her London flat but quite another to find herself going through with it."
BNC-1533,Fernando's escaladun had been wonderful last night and not direct from the freezer. All his own work.
BNC-1534,"The nurses were well trained in dealing with rich patients who were used to doing as they pleased and often disliked accepting the discipline of routine. They knew that the very old, the alcoholics, and the more than slightly batty patients (called ``eccentric'') had to be carefully supervised."
BNC-1535,"Ruth looked down, utterly unable to meet his eyes. Yet it was unjust, this anger."
BNC-1538,"There were three women before her, none of whom was dressed in black. So much detail was not available to her then but she would have agreed to it all and later she would be able to describe more of the room, the contents of the cabinets, even the names of the people represented in the photographs on top of the piano."
BNC-1541,We start by assuming that the telephone call to Mrs. Bidwell and Lorrimer's death are connected. That means the call was made by the murderer or an accomplice.
BNC-1545,"They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful."
BNC-1548,"Kate sipped her drink. ``If the Chief Constable knew that I was seeing Patrick, all hell would break loose.''"
BNC-1553,Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely?
BNC-1554,"Eve hadn't known that Mr Burns in the hardware shop was inclined to take to the drink or that Dr Johnson had a very bad temper and was heard shouting about God never putting a mouth into the world that he didn't feed. Dr Johnson was of the view that there were a lot of mouths, especially in the families with thirteen children, that God had forgotten to feed."
BNC-1558,"But then he asks himself if people would have enjoyed the story any more had it been true, and if they would have achieved any greater insight into themselves and their destinies. Of course not."
BNC-1559,What on earth did I think I was playing at? The people back at the hotel didn't know me.
BNC-156,"The one does not exclude the other. Surely Ben would understand that, if Lou explained it properly?"
BNC-1566,"I didn't know they were Twenty-fourthers, I just thought they were people wearing one shoe."
BNC-1599,"Nevertheless I can't do that. Melanie or not, it was still in confidence."
BNC-1601,I don't know what I envisaged happening once I 'd parted you and Peter. That I would step into the gap maybe.
BNC-1606,"And O said to me, the thing was. I couldn't remember."
BNC-1607,``What fun to hear Artemis laugh. She's such a serious child.''
BNC-1615,"He pulled up in fourth gear at the foot of the balustraded stone steps which led up to the solicitor's office. Totteridge, Spruce and Hardnut, Commissioners for Oaths, said the brass plate."
BNC-1616,"``We,'' said Lili, ``have just managed to force down sufficient amounts of fresh veg and protein to retain some shapeliness and complexion.'' I found it odd that Robert had chosen to distinguish me alone as English and wondered how he saw himself and Lili and I found it odd that Lili had chosen to lay claim to Englishness."
BNC-1620,"Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls."
BNC-1621,"``I know the one. Yes, it was good though I say it myself.''"
BNC-1628,"After all, it was only a season ago that we were last relegated, but the spirit within the club is such that we can bounce right back, of that I am sure. Personally, I take some comfort in knowing that I in no way contributed to our exit from Division Two."
BNC-1631,"Shannon knew she was being excluded from the conversation, though there was absolutely no evidence of that. She gave herself a mental shake."
BNC-1633,"He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments."
BNC-1635,"``A shared taste. I ought to tell you, they did talk to me about him, it can't be news to you what they are saying, that Michel has run off with your mother and that he wants to marry her.''"
BNC-1636,Until I can persuade her to unbind me - or make contact with Mephistco and convince someone back at base to forgive me my trespasses just long enough to do an override - I am confined inside the plane of reflected light. But - hoo-ha!
BNC-164,Flaubert delighted in their presence and gave them money. No doubt you wish to pat him on the head for this.
BNC-1640,"``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''."
BNC-1642,"And I resent what happened to my flat. A couple of guys think they can stake it out and wait for me, rub their filthy fingers on my clothes, piss in my bathroom, and I'm supposed to ignore it."
BNC-1643,"For a long time she had been unaware of anything lacking, but recently she had started feeling somehow... adrift. Ashley frowned."
BNC-1645,"That was then, and then's gone. It's now now."
BNC-1648,You know in a funny sort of way he was really rather prim. There was once some heroin floating round the college and there were two students who were the pushers that's the phrase for them I think - and they were both beaten up.
BNC-165,"But there was little chance of discovering who had killed him without help. Kelly decided that she had to talk to Annie, even if there was a risk that she would tell her husband."
BNC-1656,"``Here's three pence for you for a lolly if you 'll go.'' ``All right, then,'' agreed Peggy, her pout disappearing at once."
BNC-1659,This was the back of the shelter. It had an emergency exit which they all had a go at unbolting.
BNC-1660,"He left his own number, calling himself Alain - the name of her Malaysian-French ``business manager''. The next day Gina rang."
BNC-1661,"``Perhaps,'' said Neil. ``Her name is Maybelle Foy - Stair says that she is not very pretty, but is enormously rich.''"
BNC-1664,"Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema."
BNC-1665,"The birthday party was of a kind which Cecilia would have wondered at, had she been invited to it, for although a few of Bienvida's classmates were present in its early stages, by seven it had become a celebration for the grown-ups. Bienvida and Jasper were of course still there."
BNC-1667,"What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery?"
BNC-1671,"Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking."
BNC-1672,"It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work."
BNC-1673,"``I just want to show you something.'' He took her protesting hand, and laid it on a thick roll of tablecloths between their bodies."
BNC-1674,"After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this."
BNC-1675,"Now that he knows it's himself he can't help noticing the slightly ridiculous and embarrassing qualities - the way the young man frowns importantly as he talks about his job, and waves his arms about when he gets stuck for words. And the way he smiles insincerely at Howard from time to time, and looks straight into his eyes in an effort to demonstrate that he is interested in Howard as well as himself."
BNC-1676,She wouldn't shed tears over that... that brute. He didn't deserve her love - he was utterly hateful.
BNC-1677,"And, such is trust, they went on seeing it after it had gone, for by now they were used to the constant and bewildering ebb and flow of Stevenson money. Each banker took it to be part of some Brand strategy of which he was privileged to see, and be entrusted with, but a small portion."
BNC-1680,"``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge."
BNC-1681,"``Black and White Danish Dairy! Nothing near as tasty and tender as our...'' and, her mouth overflowing with steak, beans and croquette potato, Mitzi named an Austrian breed Elisabeth had never heard of (and did not imagine she would need to remember for future use)."
BNC-1682,She was very tired. Every day that week she had got up at five.
BNC-1683,"``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice."
BNC-1688,``What do you mean she disappeared?''
BNC-1694,"Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed."
BNC-1697,You 've always made it quite clear that you were staying here and that I could fuck off to the other end of the world for all you cared. You're too busy to speak some days.
BNC-1699,"He had come to entertain serious doubts about it himself. He, too, suffered from an occasional enlightening vision which came to him from the dim past and which he must have suppressed at the time... The extraordinary array of chains and fetters, manacles and shackles exhibited by Birmingham for export to America's slave states, for instance... Why had he not thought more about such exhibits?"
BNC-1707,"Powerlessness. Hope and no-hope, both at the same time."
BNC-1713,My reading might be pointless in terms of the history of literary criticism. But it's not pointless in terms of pleasure.
BNC-1716,Martha made no answer. She could not tell them that she was desperately in love with Bob Lamb.
BNC-1722,"``And somehow it seems to fit in with this landscape too - perhaps it's the sense of space...'' ``Perhaps,'' he agreed before lapsing into silence, but not before she 'd seen his face reflect the pleasure he 'd experienced at her instant recognition of what was clearly one of his favourite recordings. ``Well, we 've arrived!''"
BNC-1724,"``Lucky you. Well, she's found them some rooms in Tewkesbury, and she wants Hayley to go back.''"
BNC-1725,"Ruth found herself in his arms, her face against his broad chest - as if she were a little girl again, in the time before she 'd known he was crazy."
BNC-1730,``Please don't! I'm terribly sorry.''
BNC-1748,"His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere."
BNC-1750,"Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky."
BNC-1756,"But even as he spoke he doubted if Excepcionales Chicas would, when the plain Excepcionales was a stand-by, his favourite being Albeans or Invincibles. She turned and faced him again and on a high note she said, ``We have a few Dominicoes.''"
BNC-1761,"A pity. For myself, a great pity."
BNC-1762,He said his name was Paul Berowne. I'm afraid it didn't mean anything to me at the time.
BNC-1763,"``Oh, yes. It's just that it would have been nice to have seen the signs,'' said Caspar, rolling the maps up and packing them in his saddle bag."
BNC-177,It can't really be alive. It's not really about to bite me.
BNC-1771,I was very surprised by all this.
BNC-1776,"The curtain twitched and the Company Manager, Wallas Ward, resplendent in midnight blue dinner jacket, appeared through the centre. ``Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to have to inform you that, due to an accident to Mr. Banks, we will be unable to continue the performance.''"
BNC-1780,"Lucie was teaching Gabriel the verses. From the Creation of the World to Doomsday itself, he spoke them over, and sometimes he would recite in French."
BNC-1782,Mr Blakey raised his head from his seed-boxes. With soil-caked fingers he drew a handkerchief from a pocket and blew his nose.
BNC-1785,"``Do you understand?'' ``Yes,'' said Ruth after a gap."
BNC-18,He has been told simply that I object to marriage with Artai.
BNC-1816,"I thought about his notion that ``alien'' was just another way of saying ``devil'', or that Old Mother Walsh and her snake weren't, actually, any more real, although just as powerful, as Argol and the things from Tellenor. It didn't stand up."
BNC-183,"He asked to be put through to Alexandra's desk and was disconcerted when the voice wanted to know who was calling. ``Uh - Matthew Prescott, Cadogan's, Art Dealers,'' he said, too flustered to give a false name."
BNC-1833,"I suppose it was all to do with origins, sergeant. I started from the bottom - a poor family, elementary school, then night school while I was working as a clerk."
BNC-1834,"They look at Riva, she looks at them. Everybody blushes so hard you'd think there were roses round the cottage door."
BNC-1840,"She may fall ill, or have an accident while you were out, or set the house on fire and herself, so that you would not want to leave her even to go shopping. Once with you, you would not get rid of her easily, I feel it in my bones."
BNC-1866,Her priggishness. I admire it.
BNC-1874,"All that happens in Howe's whiny drama is that the daughter finds out her flamboyant, selfish mother has a tough row to hoe, as her father is declining into senility. (An understandable state, since he is described as having ``led the way'' for Robert Frost - whose revered poetry is misquoted - which would make him at least 110)."
BNC-1875,Betty cooked lunch happily. Lydia even brought her some dandelion leaves.
BNC-1879,"The frustration of not being able to touch her. The pleasure he had when someone he had known at school passed along the towpath, looked up and saw him, Peter Redburn, having a drink with Kate Molland."
BNC-1880,"``Sidacai has not been condemned in order that we may be served, but to satisfy the Yasa,'' Artai responded, bridling.'' - And yet maybe his death should serve you,'' Burun said."
BNC-1881,"There was more in this vein as they turned right, and Mungo realized for the first time that they were actually heading into the forest."
BNC-1885,"On the wall was a framed Miro. What kind of boy, Pumfrey marvelled, would choose a picture like that to decorate his room?"
BNC-1889,"His voice was marked by flat northern vowels and was so soft Dexter felt the muscles in his cheeks tense as he strained to hear. ``OK, Jim,'' replied Blanche with a smile."
BNC-19,"Wiping away Cynthia's tears, she urged her to be on her way and perform this last task before it was too late. ``I'm dreadfully sorry, Harry, I really am.''"
BNC-190,Erlich was breaking the rules. A Fed on assignment overseas with the ranking of Assistant Legal Attache must always work through local law-enforcement agencies.
BNC-1916,"He had thought that children were supposed to be sharp and un-sentimental and though Emmie had not written in a sentimental way exactly, she had written about her family as if they were perfect. It had puzzled him and made him very slightly jealous."
BNC-1918,"``Of course, we can have a look, but I doubt we 'll find anything. In any case, it's not vital.''"
BNC-1935,"Celia, already suffering from disturbed sleep, would wake screaming and Edna, to pacify her, took the child into her own bed. Liza, in the next room, having hardly slept at all since her disastrous meeting with Freddie Nash, lay awake, now resolved that there was only one thing left for her to do."
BNC-1937,``Let's see Leeming first.'' Duncan understood Myeloski's caution.
BNC-1938,"Ace, Defries noted, accepted everything that the Professor said. Defries was convinced."
BNC-1939,"Geoffrey said the piece was Sheep May Safely Graze by Bach. Whatever it was, it was very tinkly and repetitive, and often, just as he seemed to be getting somewhere, Meredith broke off and started all over again."
BNC-1951,"But she did not tell me about the food, or the cold, or the unkind teachers. Charlotte told me those things, much later."
BNC-1952,"Charlotte told me those things, much later. I know Maria did not tell me that the food was often burnt and uneatable, or that they could not sleep because the beds were too cold."
BNC-1953,"I know Maria did not tell me that the food was often burnt and uneatable, or that they could not sleep because the beds were too cold. She did not tell me that the poor hungry children had to wash with ice in the morning, and walk through wet snow to sit for two hours with icy feet in a cold church on Sundays."
BNC-1955,Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.''
BNC-1963,"``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.''"
BNC-1964,``You married?'' ``No.''
BNC-1971,"The senator spoke with a sudden and incredible venom, and I realised it was only that angry force that was keeping him from weeping for his two children. ``It seems,'' he went on in a calmer voice, ``that Rickie and Robin-Anne are among the sizeable minority of the population that is peculiarly prone to severe addiction.''"
BNC-1986,It's now now. I got married.
BNC-1987,``It doesn't happen very often.'' Karen went home happy at the end of the day.
BNC-1991,"Whether the relationship had gone beyond friendship Dalgliesh would now never know. She had, apparently, spent little of the money on herself, had been a dependable benefactress of the few eccentric charities of which she approved, had remembered them in her will, but without egregious generosity, and had left the residue of her estate to him without explanation, admonition or peculiar protestations of affection, although he had no doubt that the words ``my dearly beloved nephew'' meant exactly what they said."
BNC-1994,"``Oh, yes. It's just that it would have been nice to have seen the signs,'' said Caspar, rolling the maps up and packing them in his saddle bag."
BNC-1997,"And she fished a small parcel from her pocket, and showed Sally-Anne her treasure just as the horse bus finally groaned up - or neighed up, thought Sally-Anne irreverently."
BNC-2001,"The window-boxes were in full bloom. But there was a for sale board up, new today, he hadn't seen it there this morning when he set out for the meeting with the AC."
BNC-2003,"It had come as an unpleasant shock to realize how much they knew. Those employing the man, that was - the French Haute Police, as they called themselves."
BNC-2004,"He felt rather than saw the two girls glance at him appraisingly but took no notice. At just over six foot, with thick curling brown hair and eyes that owed their startling blueness to his Irish ancestry, Tom was used to being the object of female appreciation whilst being slightly puzzled by it."
BNC-2006,Jasper stood looking at the bell rope which came out of a small square aperture at what was the base of the campanile. The end of the rope was wound round a cleat high up on the wall above the door to what had once been the Science Lab.
BNC-2009,"But first Zosie had come. Rufus, driving back from London with the hashish his dealer swore was genuine Indian charas and a package of best Colombian, picked her off the street - ``a piece of property that is found ownerless''."
BNC-2012,"She did cry a little, almost soundlessly, and was furious with herself for doing so, her tears mingling with the spray of the shower. It wasn't his words that had hurt, but the intention behind them."
BNC-2014,"'Very well, I'll go. But I pick my own men, and if we ever have to fight, you obey my word.''"
BNC-2015,"If only she had been a bit more accommodating, a bit more enthusiastic. As it was he had obviously grown tired of the regular struggles and gone off to find someone who gave in more readily."
BNC-2016,George decided to plunge.
BNC-2018,"The road to the Fire Court looked quite straightforward really. It seemed as if you had to go past a large lake and on down a narrow, windy mountain road with houses dotted on each side."
BNC-2021,"Nick rolled his eyes upwards. ``Not so bad, then.''"
BNC-2022,"Feargal's censure, Phena's bitterness - a hell of a burden to carry all your adult life. And it must be a burden, knowing that your family thought you a cheat, knowing that you had hurt them, and would continue to hurt them until you died."
BNC-2024,Every dead comrade made her more determined to finish her mission. Bernice understood that.
BNC-2026,"``No, she isn't,'' said Julius's voice from the doorway. Eleanor went completely white, and Jessamy gave a small sigh of relief."
BNC-2027,"He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands."
BNC-2028,There was still the hard edge of annoyance in his voice and Jenna gulped back tears. This was not what she had intended.
BNC-2034,"Almost inaudibly, Fand said, ``Look at me, mortal, and you will see the mark of her spell in my face.'' Reluctantly, Ruth looked up into the cold changeless eyes."
BNC-2038,"She knew Eddie's gambling had had disastrous consequences for her family, but it had been a terrible shock to discover he had taken so much from his best friend as well. Could Eddie have run out of that corner deliberately because he couldn't face the consequences of his gambling?"
BNC-2046,"``And you such an antidote to the opposite sex. You could give all your money away and then you wouldn't be pursued at all, would you?''"
BNC-2049,"But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me."
BNC-2073,"Didn't have time. I never went no further than you are now, all I come for was my little secateurs, and they were on the shelf here inside the door."
BNC-2080,She 'd invited him round the previous evening and things hadn't gone at all as he 'd hoped. That's what Stuart said that Oliver said.
BNC-2086,"His small mouth was gentle. She thought, he looks like an angel."
BNC-2098,"McInnes asked anxiously, one eye on the kitchen door. ``Then I thought we 'd set up the nice Mr Sorley and his mobile Fax van and photograph him in the act of reading other people's mail.''"
BNC-2100,"``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned."
BNC-2101,"I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this."
BNC-2102,And counting. Dressing to Please. They won't miss me for a morning.
BNC-2104,"He had to do it himself. Miss Sowerby - by now an enthusiastic convert - and I had taken turns at massaging the damaged calf muscles, and suddenly I said to him, ``Jimbo, just imagine it's you that's making the muscles move.''"
BNC-2107,"The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.''"
BNC-211,"I gripped the banister and swung myself head over heels, then came out on the roof of a tower. When I made my way down its spiral staircase I found myself in the main thoroughfare of the town where I was born."
BNC-2119,``It was such a shock when I realised what Dora was suggesting. We had a terrible quarrel... I was screaming at her.
BNC-2120,"``I didn't think, I just assumed I could rent a plane and fly over.''"
BNC-2124,"``She caught a fever in the village. Benedict had it, too.''"
BNC-2143,"Firstly, I didn't know about the SAS soldiers in the British Embassy, and I am very surprised about it. Very surprised indeed, Ambassador."
BNC-2150,"Whatever I learnt, I shared with Joe, not, I'm afraid, so that he would be more educated, but so that I would be less ashamed of him in front of Estella. One Sunday Joe and I went out on the marshes, as usual, to study together."
BNC-2152,"You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind?"
BNC-2153,"She was a girl of firmly fixed, if limited, principles, and, on the purely domestic front, an excellent wife. She cooked superbly, adored her baby sons and mothered her husband, buying him linctus whenever he coughed and insisting he should take cod-liver oil in the winter."
BNC-2154,"It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once."
BNC-2163,"The producer's credit was for Robert Forbes, Jo's father and Lorna's husband, who sat beside his wife, his long, elegant legs half-hidden in the ultramarine satin folds of her skirt. Even in his eighties he was a fine-looking man, the more so in any kind of formal dress."
BNC-2165,My wife went back to Britain. She said I 'd chosen the path to failure.
BNC-2175,I don't mean! You're always telling me what I should be - or do - or say.
BNC-2180,Bohemian pyrotechnics are not what marriage to Stu promises. Gillian has landed herself nothing other than the youngest older man she could find.
BNC-2182,"``Who knows? The point is, do we go with it or not?''"
BNC-2185,"She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her."
BNC-2186,"Doyle, the Woman, the television news-readers, Hank, the girl and the policeman - even his own face in the mirror - all told him that he was Philip Doyle. That Liam Shakespeare was a hostage in a house in Shelley Grove."
BNC-2191,"If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings?"
BNC-2192,"Little did they know this was the fellow for whom The Flippity Flop Young Man was written, and I wasn't about to tell them. Would it have made any difference if I had?"
BNC-2203,Paddington was beginning to loom slightly larger than a man's hand on the horizon. Paddington was where the murdered Kemp had stood and phoned The Randolph the previous day.
BNC-2227,Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do.
BNC-2229,"She was sick with worry about everything. It's like being caught in huge sticky web - the more you struggle, the more entangled you get."
BNC-2237,It must be because I'm not reacting to the socket like the receptionist would. Her own horror burst out of its chrysalis.
BNC-2239,"``Funny that the met people should get it so wrong.'' Outside the flight deck, a wisp of white flicked past the black window."
BNC-2242,"Forced to listen to all those hoary chestnuts that cast me and my kind as the bad guys, and the butt of all the jokes. What arrogance, what cheek, what chutzpah!"
BNC-2244,"I also see that we're about as alike as chalk and cheese, because I would never sell out a whole species for the wrongs of one group."
BNC-2252,"And between claws and body, a Medusa's head, with cold, unlidded eyes. She looked at her drawing and was pleased."
BNC-2258,"Carnelian must know special runes to inscribe around the eye-screen and arcane litanies to incant, to make it serve this two-way purpose, which perhaps had been the true purpose of the device in the first place... ``I'm listening,'' Jaq shouted. ``I'm all ears.''"
BNC-2263,"I wondered if I should continue working with Joe in a plain, honest way of life, and perhaps marry Biddy."
BNC-2266,"You have refused to pay what has been asked for my return, but if you knew what I have become, a fearless old man with nothing left to lose, you would pay twice as much to have me kept away! Whatever happens now, my children, we can never be again as we were."
BNC-227,"``But my father always taught me never to be afraid of pointing out the obvious. I'm sure you have noticed the implication of the letter, that the writer has in fact observed Jenny undressing for bed?''"
BNC-2295,"He had deceived her utterly from start to finish, and such calculated deceit was a downright insult!"
BNC-2296,Either way the result is inevitably the same. A severed jugular!
BNC-2307,So the hound followed the scent and hunted this man. But there is one thing I don't understand.
BNC-2313,"It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether."
BNC-232,"He would be furious, of course, and rightly so. But, even if she could find the nerve to admit to her deception, she couldn't own up to a thing - Cara was depending on her!"
BNC-2325,"Where's he got all that from? Some kind of Gerald Durrell character, is he, going round the world collecting creepy-crawlies?"
BNC-233,And I don't want to have to lie to them. The kidnappers have given us until October the eleventh to deliver the document and I haven't despaired of finding it before then.
BNC-2330,Why was the Provost angry? Why did the wild friend ride from Hamptonshire to Hungary?
BNC-2332,"Tonight... The cool air caressed her bare arms, and Folly shivered and turned back towards the house. What did women do, who were waiting for their lovers?"
BNC-2337,"But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds."
BNC-2338,"The slaves continued their stoking, shuffling to and from the cart, heaving the beech logs into the next furnace. The Robemaker moved forward, prodding Nuadu onwards and, as they moved down the centre of the Workshop, the blazing furnaces roaring on each side of them, Nuadu felt his skin already shrivelling from the heat."
BNC-2340,"I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like."
BNC-236,"Ari felt very old as she walked back to the group. It seemed that, all around her, things were changing - old, beloved routines that had felt safe and comfortable were decaying into new patterns."
BNC-237,"He was so very young, so hurt and confused by all that had happened in his life, it seemed only natural that he should want to lash out. And if it was her he was lashing out at, so be it."
BNC-2375,"At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing."
BNC-2378,``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.''
BNC-2388,"``Willy did mention it. I was puzzled, I 'll admit, but now I understand.''"
BNC-2394,"``Rather a long shot, wasn't it? Twenty years?''"
BNC-2397,Did you know that? Pluto... the God of Hades.
BNC-2414,She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her.
BNC-2416,"At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his."
BNC-2427,"The machine does not function, he wrote. The desired outcome is delayed."
BNC-2428,"She imagined tiny villages far to the north of England which had no electricity or telegraphs, which believed in lake monsters and King Arthur, and were not so different from northern towns near Canada. The northern English towns might not know or care that Wall Street had crashed."
BNC-2429,Yesterday I couldn't have done it. Couldn't have picked up the pen and opened the notebook and faced the blank page.
BNC-2430,"Laying the Christmas decoration on the eiderdown with care, he thought about Vic. What had he really been saying as they sat among the trees?"
BNC-2436,But he had called on Lorton on the Sunday of Newley's disappearance. Newley must have put him up to it.
BNC-2438,"Surely, the fact that he was out here, calmly taking a holiday, might be an encouraging sign? The machinations of corporate sharks were a slightly hazy area in her experience."
BNC-2449,"Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him."
BNC-2452,"If I beckon, she will certainly come to me! he thought, and his mind whirled, so that for a moment he barely saw the waiting Fiana candidates and the glittering Sun Chamber."
BNC-2453,"During this interlude, Charlotte reminded herself of the different bluffs and deceptions each was practising. Would Natasha admit she had known of Maurice's plan from the outset?"
BNC-2459,"The ninth bomber came out of a lightening sky at six o'clock exactly, and though she sat there for another hour, it was the last.''... and three of our aircraft have failed to return,'' the man who read the news would intone on the midday bulletin."
BNC-2460,Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet.
BNC-2462,"Obispal's gaze drifted towards Meh ` Lindi, and he frowned as if adding the final piece to a puzzle which had been perplexing him, but not liking the pattern that he saw."
BNC-2463,Out on the waste ground is a guy with his head bashed in. Ludo swung his club at him with all that strength he hardly knows he possesses.
BNC-2464,I believe the rooms have already been set aside. Does Dr Serafin know about them yet?
BNC-2468,"I promised Mr Harvey I would. Of course, he's terribly anxious for me to settle down out there, marry Cora-Beth and become an American citizen, the way his father did years ago."
BNC-249,Polly met his troubled gaze.
BNC-2490,"Modify the arachnids, said the researchers. Change their bodies and conditions, and you could get fibres like glass, still monofilament, but with logarithmic progressions of possibilities of strength and flexibility, and the ability to resonate light-particles or sound-waves undistorted, scarcely weakened over thousands of miles."
BNC-2491,"Change their bodies and conditions, and you could get fibres like glass, still monofilament, but with logarithmic progressions of possibilities of strength and flexibility, and the ability to resonate light-particles or sound-waves undistorted, scarcely weakened over thousands of miles. Who said the arachnids had to be totally organic?"
BNC-2497,"While the rest of the gang dived into the pub opposite to use the toilets, I called in at H. R. Higgins (Coffee-man) Ltd and bought six gift boxes of coffee (assorted) and two of tea (scented). That was my Christmas shopping sewn up."
BNC-2499,"Alice smiled and nodded, and got up to stand at the window, looking out. Indolent and privileged, daughter of the Establishment, she leaned on the sill, watching the goings-on in the street, and listened to the sounds of paper sliding on paper."
BNC-2504,"Is that what you're saying? Although why you should imagine I would want acceptance into your family when I have a perfectly good family of my own, I have no idea."
BNC-251,"The men surrounding them were squat and dark, their expressions callous and indifferent. They were just doing their job."
BNC-2523,"Which brings us to Selkirk's verses. We know the falcon is James, the lamb is Angus, the Lion also is the King of Scotland."
BNC-2527,So her early impressions were confirmed. He was an exacting man to work for.
BNC-2528,And she still didn't know what was on Luke Hunter's mind. But the day after that things began to get a little clearer.
BNC-2533,"There! I have a genius for this, which I offer to God."
BNC-2560,``But that's not fair! That's downright cheating!''
BNC-2566,"I didn't understand some parts of your letter. I'm a woman, or rather a girl, and not clever."
BNC-2580,``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''.
BNC-2584,"If we all want it put a stop to, will the government do something about it, or will it be like you said, Mr. Gerrard?"
BNC-2604,But I have to admit you confuse me. First you are looking for a man named Svend - then it is your sister.
BNC-2615,By the next day we were ready to go to work. What tells me that this is right?
BNC-2616,"Obviously Edwin had not murdered Francis but he had created a situation in which violence was more likely. The main provisions of the will were devisive and certain to breed strife, but they provided no motive for Francis's murder."
BNC-263,The assassin's tone and bearing were completely confident.
BNC-2630,"The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know."
BNC-2658,"Therese, lying on her narrow bed at the Goldener Adler, was fighting overwhelming panic. She was exhausted and she wasn't even taking the lead in tonight's performance."
BNC-2661,"Valence the void-brain, Valence the virtuous valet. Why couldn't the figger choose his own portion of titanic anatomy to shaft?"
BNC-2664,"I only need that, thought Sara. What was she going to do about Matthew and Jenny?"
BNC-2670,She had spoiled the child rotten. But what else could she have done?
BNC-2677,"He said. ``Not if I want to continue fitting into all my clothes.'' Good grief, what century was this man living in?"
BNC-2678,"When one morning she told me that they were going away, I can't say that it was a surprise. The way she put it was that Michel had very kindly offered to drive her to Paris, which she had never seen properly (Simon used to grumble so about not being able to take her because of the war)."
BNC-293,Alan Dysart. Harry's mother reacted to his arrival as if the Prince of Wales had called by unexpectedly.
BNC-297,"How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough."
BNC-299,"Colin hated the way he inspected the rag before folding the contents into the centre and forcing it into his trouser pocket. Smith obliged on all counts before announcing firmly, ``It was Arson.''"
BNC-300,It was true that Robert had always liked pigs.
BNC-304,"And Sarah knew, while Peter didn't. It amazed her that she should find it difficult to tell him."
BNC-325,"She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him."
BNC-326,"He had exercised effective control of the labour force for ten years at the giant plant and had been able to bring the workers out on strike at the drop of a hat. It was he, Clasper, who dictated to management the size of the labour force they would require to produce a given number of products, regardless of any figure which management might arrive at by employing accurately measured work standards."
BNC-328,He had realised as soon as he had employed Michael that he had found himself a kindred spirit. Michael was innately honest.
BNC-335,Meg realized she 'd been a complete fool. She could have said it differently.
BNC-342,"I don't know if it's sex, or fear that I'm up to some trick. If he does think about the pictures, he accepts everything I say."
BNC-350,And after that - nothing. Silence.
BNC-356,"Indeed, in those busy days, our servants ' hall would often witness a gathering of some of the finest professionals in England talking late into the night by the warmth of the fire. Sometimes, naturally, there would be strong disagreements, but more often than not, the atmosphere was dominated by a feeling of mutual respect."
BNC-36,"I told you once before what I believe in, Michael Riven. I believe in friendship, also."
BNC-363,"``Oh, come on! Don't lie, to me or yourself.''"
BNC-365,Anybody who's not a shrink (or my wife) only sees an ink blot when they look at one. This is an absolute nuthouse.
BNC-370,"Who knows how many quarrels, false accusations, unnecessary dismissals, how many promising careers cut short can be attributed to a butler's slovenliness at the stage of drawing up the staff plan? Indeed, I can say I am in agreement with those who say that the ability to draw up a good staff plan is the cornerstone of any decent butler's skills."
BNC-371,"You will not dispute, I presume, that Mr Marshall of Charleville House and Mr Lane of Bridewood have been the two great butlers of recent times. Perhaps you might be persuaded that Mr Henderson of Branbury Castle also falls into this rare category."
BNC-373,"But to make matters worse the usual comfort a father has in these situations - that is, the notion that his son gave his life gloriously for king and country - was sullied by the fact that my brother had perished in a particularly infamous manoeuvre. Not only was it alleged that the manoeuvre had been a most un-British attack on civilian Boer settlements, overwhelming evidence emerged that it had been irresponsibly commanded with several floutings of elementary military precautions, so that the men who had died - my brother among them - had died quite needlessly."
BNC-374,"Obeying his instruction, I proffered my hand, open palm upwards, towards the animal. The ratbird climbed on and began to preen its fur unconcernedly."
BNC-376,"``Can you?'' ``The wedding of course,'' said my mother ill-advisedly."
BNC-385,"At this time of year not much, it's been a dryish summer, and there's not a lot of water coming down. Say half a knot - and that's probably an over-estimate."
BNC-394,"Jotan looked as though he was considering the alternatives. ``We are summoned to audience with Artai later,'' he said, ``but until then we can do as we please.''"
BNC-396,"Fernando drew away from her and Ruth scrambled to her feet, smoothing the creases from her dress. While he shook out the blanket and brushed down his trousers Ruth turned her pinched face towards the sea."
BNC-397,"Alas, poor Cecil. Better for him, maybe, had he stuck to his original scheme."
BNC-398,"Still, she could get started on a draft. She took out her pocket recorder and began dictating."
BNC-402,I shall not waver even at this supreme moment. Nor shall I again urge the objections cited above to the ``murderous conspiracy'' theory.
BNC-403,"He had only to say he admired Grace Bird's fortitude and instantly her chin stiffened with resolve. He had but to comment favourably on the kittenish qualities of Babs Osborne for her to curl up as best she could on the plush seat beside him, her thumb in her mouth."
BNC-406,"The shock wave was delayed by only a few more seconds, and then it rolled over them like a small hurricane. No loose ends."
BNC-407,What had brought Gharr and Ten-huc and Pulvidon to the planet at the same time? Why were all of them so interested in why I was there?
BNC-412,"Unlike Aunt Kit, who believed it to be a barbaric rite, intolerable between reasonable men and women, Aunt Lilian, the headmistress, simply felt it her duty to point out that a career - any career - would be less easy once a girl was lumbered with a husband and children. (Though in fact she would not have said ``lumbered'', not because she was afraid to put forward an unpopular view, but because she was an honourable and exact woman.)"
BNC-413,She had known Mandy all her life. The papers might talk about the swinging sixties but the nearest most girls of Maura's age got to it was in the clothes they wore.
BNC-415,"However, I will let the gynandrous renegade stay here under one condition. If Penumbra questions either of us, we will not lie."
BNC-418,"``I think I have it all now, Mr Robinson.'' Mary almost laughed aloud at Hope's tolerant gravity."
BNC-420,"And he turned, shy, somehow, and they held each other. Nathan smelt warm sleep, clean skin."
BNC-422,"He trusted the captains of his ships, he trusted his trading partners in the East, in the Indian Ocean, over the Atlantic, around the African coast. His clerks, his associates in Liverpool, his bank, his builders, his carpenters, those who supplied him with his furniture and his clothes - Mr Crump moved in a world of total trust."
BNC-426,"Imagine if, for instance, we could get him standing up in public, get him photographed, on newsreel, all around the world, saying that we were fighting a just war, that Hitler was insane, that we had to win. Imagine him appealing to America to come in quickly, fight the good fight with us, shoulder to shoulder."
BNC-427,Pictures of Lizzy as a child were everywhere. She shook her head.
BNC-428,His reaction to the news had been partly predictable and partly complex and more disturbing. There had been the natural initial shock of disbelief at hearing of the unexpected death of any person even casually known.
BNC-431,This was a sheer waste of time. He would probably land and then tell them to walk back.
BNC-435,"You say you love me. Well, I love you too."
BNC-454,``Keep your faces down.'' Beth feared for the children's sight as she lurched forward to grab the branch.
BNC-455,"What you should do - if you were sophisticated - was just give the glass a swirl and sniff, which would tell you whether or not the wine was off. So this was what Ollie took to doing, reducing his performance to a series of loud inhalings followed by a curt nod."
BNC-459,"Come on, convince them. He realized that his last chance was to make his captors believe that Donna knew where the book they sought was hidden, whatever it was."
BNC-461,"It had sounded very plausible through the claret and the brandy and the smoke of Ben Braithwaite's excellent cigars. Less so the next morning when, his stomach seriously disordered and his head aching, John-William had started to wonder why a man like Goldsborough who was'' gentry'' through and through despite his odd goings-on at the Fleece, should be making revolutionary suggestions as to how the'' squires ' government might be brought down."
BNC-463,He could be genuinely offering her his guidance around the exposition or he could be offering her guidance in the art of something else! Ruth's eyes sought out Steve as if he had the answers she needed.
BNC-468,"On the second day, Tim showed Anna the system in the warehouse. On the third, he explained how to use the computer for reordering."
BNC-473,"As you saw, I 've got my tent set up now on the island. I 'll work there, and I 'll come back and sleep in the house."
BNC-476,"The nun and her superior exchanged glances. Then Mother Francis, with a small inclination of her head, gave the nun leave to take this very awkward child away."
BNC-48,"The marriage she had assumed naively would be the end of every serious relationship now seemed a very distant - if not unreachable - shore. Whereas Luke was very near, and the feelings he aroused in her were like an undertow, pulling her down."
BNC-488,"Another vivid picture, this time of herself standing by the ford in fitzAlan's arms, insinuated itself into Isabel's mind. She had a distinctly uncomfortable feeling that he was not referring to the fight which had followed that little incident."
BNC-491,Doug emerges from the cabin looking blue with cold. He smiles weakly at everyone.
BNC-492,Maybe neither Dixie nor the topcoat had criminal records. Certainly the old man will have said he saw a man robbing them.
BNC-50,Gold dust. He returned the other three books to the trunk and replaced the mattresses.
BNC-500,She shivered. The letter had definitely stated that she was to be met.
BNC-505,"At the sight of him I would smell the dust of the confessional and remember the mixture of boredom, shame and relief as I said my penances. I was familiar with the view that the priesthood is beyond shock, being entirely cognisant of the whole sum of human folly and evil from the outpourings of the penitent, but I wasn't convinced."
BNC-509,"Perhaps I might have recognized my own hypocrisy, if it had not been for Richard's behaviour in the next months. He brought me flowers, took me out to dinner and the theatre, and was generally attentive to me, as if I were his mistress and not an old married woman."
BNC-510,"Children aren't real people, in the sense that they are not small males and females but a separate species which will (probably) grow into one or the other in due time. Younger children in particular, before the insidious and evil influence of society and their parents have properly got to them, are sexlessly open and hence perfectly likeable."
BNC-53,"Contrary to what he had suggested, Marc was a good, fast skier, and it was Sarella who had had difficulty in keeping up. But then she hadn't expected it to be any different."
BNC-540,"``Look, Preston, I can't listen to any more. You burst into my office talking about killings.''"
BNC-549,"My dear girl, it's a small fortune! No one in her right mind would turn her back on that!"
BNC-555,You could have both gone direct to England from New York. But you wanted to come up this way.
BNC-566,"There was latent power in every careless move he made. His body was extremely fit, not an ounce of surplus flesh on him, and every trained muscle and sinew was ready to act in a split-second to whatever the brain required of it."
BNC-568,"What my source was up to, I have no idea."
BNC-570,He had his own worries. There was going to be an official inquiry into the shooting on the arrest of Terry Place.
BNC-571,"John's overcoat of a thin material in the rather common ``Italian'' style did not look very warm, she thought with a pang. They walked in silence for a few minutes."
BNC-572,"He often referred to the royal garden party when he was in a good frame of mind. Scarlet still found the episode entirely mysterious, since she could think of no reason at all why they had been invited."
BNC-573,"He smacked her gold-black-striped bottom, and sent her, fuming, out to her little car. ``Any beer in the house?''"
BNC-574,"Without the guidance of the nuns, Tilda seemed to have lost her last vestige of moral sense. Partisan Street, the first street on the way up from the boats, was, as has been said, considered a rough place - a row of decrepit two-up, two-down brick houses, the refuge of crippled and deformed humanity."
BNC-579,"Her first school had been a church school, and twice a week they 'd had to set their chairs in a raggedy half-circle and fidget their way through one of the vicar's haranguing lectures on Life. He was a small man, bald and beady-eyed and turkey-necked, and only in retrospect could she see that he 'd probably been something of a mental case as well."
BNC-583,"Obviously he did not make himself known so we can only speculate as to who he was watching, but we are all hoping that Trevor Proby will soon get the call. Likewise, supporters have reported to me that a well known, flamboyant Football League Premier Division chairman has been seen at ``The Tip''."
BNC-584,"The meat tea was probably the answer. A big slice of ham, or grilled bacon, or a few sausages, and they could put a few extra on Benny's plate in case she felt the need of it."
BNC-585,"He had had a stiff greeting that morning from the Grand Commander Louis de Magnac, whom he had tricked over Loppe, and again on shipboard coming from Rhodes. With him was Brother William de Combort, who had entertained Primaflora so warmly at Rhodes in the belief that she was in Carlotta's employment."
BNC-586,"In fact, as the great challenge of the conference drew nearer, an astonishing change seemed to come over my father. It was almost as though some supernatural force possessed him, causing him to shed twenty years."
BNC-587,"As the man crossed the street and started work, Harry headed back into the college. He could believe some drunken classics student had run amok with a spray-can, but not that he had chanced to write two words of no classical significance beneath the window of the room where Harry happened to be staying."
BNC-588,"``Bowled over,'' Graham said nervously, then wished he could gulp the words back somehow. Neither of the others seemed to think anything of it though."
BNC-590,"But even the bone itself is eaten away in places, thought Nuadu, sick with horror. The Robemaker's skin was covered with suppurating sores, great festering, oozing ulcers, leprous growths, cancerous chancres."
BNC-591,"This contract was, perhaps, the only evidence from which I could deduce Helmut's hurt. By giving me a little he was showing both concern for me and his determination that I should pay materially for what I had done to him."
BNC-592,"Yes, he has been quite unbearably lonely here. And knew that the remoteness and the gentle strength had been hard won."
BNC-593,"There was no point in giving her further cause. The nun sighed heavily as she looked back at her sixth-year class, heads bent over their composition books all intent on their essay, ``The Evils of Emigration''."
BNC-599,"There was a group of curious onlookers... Marie felt her legs give way beneath her, she sat down on the edge of the pavement, feet in the gutter, doubled-up, sick and winded as if someone had punched her in the stomach. She lifted up her head and looked again."
BNC-600,"This was the first time she had seen or heard of d'Urberville since she had left Trantridge. And although he stood there openly as a preacher, as a religious man, she still felt afraid of him."
BNC-601,His microphone whistled a little and Sally winced in embarrassment.
BNC-602,"Charles, who shared G.K. Chesterton's opinion that the temperament is a disease which afflicts amateurs, grunted."
BNC-605,"She returned his kiss, her lips soft, sweet, utterly giving. He began an exploration of her body, a constant revelation of tormenting pleasure."
BNC-606,"``No,'' answered Willie, ``course not.'' He wriggled back further on the bed till he was leaning up against the wall."
BNC-607,"He was seated at the back of the court, initially angry that someone had screwed up with the tickets, but he quickly realized that every few games he was almost directly behind her. Each time she bent to receive serve he found himself staring mesmerized at her derriere."
BNC-61,"Nicky approached her with the assumption that men are naturally right and it is the role of women to follow their lead. Constance, whose confidence was growing daily, was not prepared to give in to Nicky's wishes merely because of his sex."
BNC-611,"As Jenna waited to be collected in Paris she began to think that this was not a good idea after all. It was something she had been determined not to do right from the first, and yet here she was, waiting for Alain Lemarchand, butterflies in her stomach threatening to make her feel sick."
BNC-613,"I had been there and I knew it as a beautiful seaside resort, but that wasn't why I was so delighted. It was because it was in Yorkshire."
BNC-618,Just knowing they are there in the bag is as comforting as Victor finds his cheroots. I can already feel the shape of one resting in my palm.
BNC-62,"He did not expect Osman openly to agree but he thought it quite likely that the Sheikh might indicate his willingness to accept Owen's proposition. He thought he saw in Osman, beneath the intransigence and fanaticism, a certain uneasiness as to his own role in the affair."
BNC-625,"Your honesty shines out of your face, my darling. It isn't your fault that cynical men like myself won't let themselves believe what they see!"
BNC-629,His eye fell on Ronan. Already he seemed to have the reassuring kind of manner one associated with being a doctor.
BNC-631,"And she 'd achieved, what was more, almost entirely by her own efforts - even her stepfather had granted her that. For, unlike Jake, Douglas had never accused her of having cheated Ryan out of his fortune - in spite of the fact that, like the rest of the family, he had never known the tragic truth about his son."
BNC-634,Maggie rocked her closer still. She could understand the guilt that Ana carried.
BNC-636,"Maybe tomorrow, or the day after that. Maybe never, Kirov dared to reflect, in a rare moment of optimism."
BNC-637,I can't afford to get bogged down in the weeds. But at least you know she did leave.
BNC-638,Country churches were never locked. You could wander in at any time.
BNC-642,"Obispal had virtually blackmailed Voronov-Vaux to allow him to root out the rebellion with wanton use of force, resulting in all those millions of deaths. Voronov-Vaux's red vision was his vulnerable flaw."
BNC-646,She was about to tell him that was his own stupid fault and that she wasn't here to wait on him - particularly since he had proved to be so inhospitable. But she bit back the words.
BNC-650,"She longed for a weapon, for even a hairpin, and knowing that she did not have one, she knew too that she was totally defenceless, unarmed and alone. She could feel the great flight of the dragon and sensed that she was high in air and travelling fast towards the sunset."
BNC-652,"``Molly likes having an audience for her tales and it passes the hours for them.'' When Miss Louisa had a second more severe stroke at the end of August, and Miss Ellen another heart attack, both old ladies died within a few days of each other."
BNC-654,Joseph spat and spluttered blood.
BNC-656,"Once married, Arnold began to give parties, admirably hosted by the young and vivacious Nancy, for the artists before whom he became speechless with respect. His wife, who was never speechless in those days, entertained the painters, art critics and sculptors more successfully than her husband and found herself slipping into various love affairs which her Arnold, smiling quietly and getting on with his business and his collection, seemed to expect."
BNC-659,"He didn't come till the next day, he had so many calls, and all the same - sick children. By this time, Celia had the same throat and both were in the same bed for company."
BNC-662,"If I were to go in now, thought Rupert, I should attract far more attention that if I 'd gone earlier. The whole thing must be nearly over - hardly anything on the stalls - nothing to eat - people looking surreptitiously at their watches wondering if they were at all justified in slipping away home."
BNC-663,"If Dana left me, I knew I would never love anyone again - or at least, not in the same way, with the same intensity. So I clung to him through the poetry I went on helping him to write."
BNC-667,"Our groundshare next season will show what the team is really made of as we run out for home games on the unfamiliar battlefield of St Dodimeads Comprehensive. With the pitch being unavailable during term time, three-quarters of our games will be away."
BNC-668,"At the far side was a second gate, nearly as massive as the first. Soldiers were pushing it open and Rostov saw that the whole inner yard was a clever device to protect the city."
BNC-67,"But now these beginnings had become something of a joke between them and the congregation had learned to accept them with amused tolerance. They always made Sophia think how much more Mark would be appreciated in a different sort of parish, though she never said anything about it now."
BNC-670,He could perform miracles. He could turn what had happened into a dream.
BNC-672,"He never wrote anything after the war, you notice. I expect he found he 'd sold his working-class birthright for a mess of Bloomsbury pottage."
BNC-681,"However, a lie might not be necessary. After all, something must have made me do it, pointless and unjustified as it seemed now."
BNC-698,"``We're about to run out of time. I would like to thank you for coming into the studio today, and I'm sure we 'll receive a lot of letters from our listeners about what's been said.''"
BNC-703,"He didn't say he loved her but,'' I think we're going to love each other, Lyn.'' From the pulled and sagging pockets of his jacket, his Sunday-go-to-meetings suit, his only suit, Dadda produced a cairngorm and silver ring for Lyn and a pearl-handled Stilton knife for Stephen."
BNC-704,"But it was not deserted. The empty refrigerator and the absence of perishable food like bread and milk suggested that Stavanger had left expecting to be away for some time, but that conflicted with the pyjamas under the pillow in the bedroom, and the razor in the bathroom."
BNC-705,"He also liked swimming and cycling. He said that he wrote stories, though he had to admit that he had never got further than the first two pages."
BNC-706,"Methodically, he replaced the screwdriver in a toolbox in the garden shed, though he was not known as a tidy man. When he unwound the rope from the cleat the bell rang once."
BNC-709,A small fleet of boats were now in position in an arc around the entrance.
BNC-713,For the first time in my life I could not confess all my sins to the priest. Father Jankowski looked at me so kindly I could not tell him.
BNC-714,``For God's sake keep them in their seats. If we get panic people are going to be crushed to death and there will be mayhem in the car park.''
BNC-717,"It was hard to tell what time of day it was. The ground was too warm, Rostov was sure, for it to be morning."
BNC-720,"``It's your own silly fault,'' Claire said. ``You think people have nothing better to do than listen to you.''"
BNC-725,"The lunch trade had mostly disappeared so he wasn't hard to spot. He was at a window table but he was ignoring the river, being deep in conversation with a middle-aged man wearing a suit and a short sheepskin car coat with matching brown suede shoes."
BNC-726,O listened. As he listened he could smell the man.
BNC-727,"``Yes, dreadful isn't it,'' she agreed. ``Still, the farmers need it, Rodney says, and the garden...'' Compared with the near-despair that she had shown during their recent encounter in the church, her manner was almost jaunty."
BNC-733,"He knew he could never talk himself straight with you. He obviously knew something about Mahoney's blackmail racket, and figured the girl would be in on it."
BNC-736,What would be would be. Samantha might be back home by the early hours of Monday morning.
BNC-738,How did Selden know that the hound was following him? We know he ran a long way.
BNC-747,"That evening Shannon steered well clear of Dane, all but tiptoeing around him, determined not to land in any more confrontations. From now till this snow siege ended, she would simply live under the same roof, but keep to her own side of an invisible barrier, she decided."
BNC-748,"Then they had an open patch of land to cross before reaching the shelter of the woods about a hundred yards away. It was risky - the sentry would be sure to hear their horse as it picked up speed - but crossing the dangerous waters of the Severn at night was riskier, and would point them in the wrong direction for Winchester."
BNC-751,The woman paused and stared at her suspiciously. ``If the constable is coming anyway what have I to lose by giving you a good pasting and throwing the boots in the canal?''
BNC-752,"However, it was no use pondering on unanswerable questions. The King was steadily gaining more support."
BNC-753,"It wasn't drunkenness - she 'd been drunk twice, and neither time had been anything like this - but something else altogether. She didn't know what her mother was going to say when Wayne finally got her home."
BNC-754,"The mother had taken a house by the sea for a month for her daughter's health and it turned out to be an Indian summer that year. When they came up the grassy track that led to the headland, out of the wood that clothed the side of the valley where the village was, the girl was delighted and her mother relieved that she liked it."
BNC-756,"It seemed so unfair, somehow. Here was a woman who had been trying to have a child ever since her marriage and yet she, Celia, had conceived not merely without any difficulty but on the one and only time she had not taken steps to prevent it."
BNC-757,"So far as Vecchi was concerned, the guy must have climbed into a hole in the ground and pulled the lid over his head. I 'd noticed a couple of characters in different bars who also seemed more interested in the people than the liquor, and it didn't need any Sherlock Holmes to know who was paying for their drinks."
BNC-759,"To get four miles they covered twenty, and they took nearly two hours. Edward was sweating lightly when they walked into the house."
BNC-760,"Like many questions which the police were obliged to put, these were a formality, it being clear that the bargeowners couldn't answer them."
BNC-761,"She stole a final critical glance at her face, mentally awarding herself top marks for skilful covering of the tear-stains which had marred her skin just a few minutes before. Now her eyes, with their clever shading of amber and gold, shone back at her, large and lustrous - and the lipstick she 'd chosen made her mouth look lusciously inviting."
BNC-763,Where Roman Wyatt was concerned she was like a snail without a shell. She had never been so aware of anyone as she was of the powerful man who had entered her life so abruptly.
BNC-766,"Not only did Annie make elderflower lemonade as a refreshing summer drink, but elderberry syrup was a warming and beneficial cordial in the winter. Jonadab always relied on the leaves for treating any horse which developed an infection or chill in the bladder."
BNC-774,Then it cried. It was another girl.
BNC-780,Matthew rode on feeling a little more at peace with himself. He skirted the spruce plantation and supposed that at some point he should tell Sara about it.
BNC-782,Barak looked around the spacious hallway in awe. The three-tier Czechoslovakian crystal chandelier was the only reminder of its once resplendent grandeur.
BNC-783,``Mr Fearon!'' There was no reply.
BNC-784,"This master is a sex-maniac, this one an alcoholic. And they're usually perfectly innocuous chaps."
BNC-786,``They 'll have it tomorrow morning - or as soon as I'm free to give it.'' Anthea gave a cool nod of acknowledgement.
BNC-787,"I was emotionally devastated, but I was not going back with the intention of finding a man to take care of me, to pay my bills, to embellish me and play papa as Helmut had."
BNC-788,Folly tried to sink back inconspicuously into the soft leather seat and take stock. The results were unpromising.
BNC-790,"``Walk with her.'' Elizabeth was walking with Betty behind the doctor and April, who was clinging to his arm and, as it were, daintily tripping up."
BNC-791,``That's good.'' Ruth stood looking at her.
BNC-792,"Meh ' Lindi did not develop the lower set of arms nor the bony, sinuous tail. Too much to expect a new pair of arms to grow out of her ribs, or her coccyx to elongate so enormously."
BNC-793,"Montaine was still living in the attic at the time. I remember Otto mentioning that she entertained him there with Jean-Claude, and only later moved out into a room over the Cafe du Coin, to be nearer her ``young man''."
BNC-794,"In the distance, right at the bottom of the hill, they saw throngs of people. A fine Sunday afternoon always brought the trippers out."
BNC-795,"For it would merely herald the beginning of another. ``Remember the last time we waited together like this, Charlie?''"
BNC-796,"But, he warns, this universal spirit, which his uncle, Emile Durkheim, had airily postulated, can only be recognized after taking into account psychological, religious, magical and pragmatic factors. This is clearly impossible."
BNC-797,Meik saw she 'd been foolish to come. She knew he was right.
BNC-801,"Watching as he grinned up at the bus driver, said something and laughed, she felt a hollow ache inside. It had been a long time since she 'd laughed, joined in a joke, been silly just for the hell of it."
BNC-803,Gloria remarked as they shared their coffee break in the kitchen. Melissa suppressed a sigh.
BNC-808,"You added the arsenic, the antimony or the heavy metal. And they took it down dutifully."
BNC-810,Merrill dropped into her chair. That altercation with Luke had drained her.
BNC-813,"Spruce, on the other hand, looked to her like an intelligent adversary. But he would be hindered unless he knew the methods and presuppositions of the Church and its clergy."
BNC-816,``Yeah.'' Lorton wondered what was the purpose of that unnecessary question.
BNC-817,"Above them on the balcony terrace, Alina Petrovna stood a little way back from the parapet. She looked at the moon, the lake, and the dark forest beyond, but she saw only defeat."
BNC-819,"On the third day, she was taken for interrogation, and try as she might, she couldn't stop the butterflies in her stomach. She was pushed into a big office where she was faced by a rather handsome Obersturmfuhrer."
BNC-820,"``Oh, very well,'' he said wearily."
BNC-821,"Maybe after a few thousand years of marmot for breakfast, dinner and tea they fancied a change. Maybe they had a sense of adventure."
BNC-823,"I was angry with her for not saying anything, not doing anything. I still had a formless feeling that she understood me where my mother did not."
BNC-825,So maybe it was somewhere on mat land me chopper has put down. He had been driving at high speed when me helicopter flew past him.
BNC-829,"``For such a person, finding a protector might not be so difficult, even in Edinburgh.'' Jean smiled."
BNC-83,"By the time they returned, Ingrid had less than a week left, and she was becoming agitated. If British Naval Intelligence heard nothing from her, they 'd presume the Dane was hostile, and the raid would go ahead as planned."
BNC-837,"I'm putting out no more clean linen until tomorrow. Fighting, indeed."
BNC-839,"L. Underneath, in purple ink, had been added. ``And love, Fenella'', with a capital X as a kiss."
BNC-844,"On his orders the tapster broached a good cask of wine and brought across a bowl of water. Joachim cleaned my face, wiping dirt from the bruises whilst I greedily gulped the thick red claret."
BNC-85,He 'd gone. Philip had to get them back.
BNC-87,"I'm only edgy because there might be something being planned, but I'm probably completely wrong. Parr's probably coming for a business deal with my daddy and feels the need to have a grip of me, the usual thing, that's all."
BNC-870,``How do you know all this?'' Kelly's mind was racing.
BNC-872,"``All right, so it wasn't the bottle by the bed. What was it, then?''"
BNC-874,"There was no answer. Moving carefully, Benny stepped around the edges of the room, and opened the window shutters."
BNC-875,"Petion stayed nervously by the door, and Ace joined him there, watching suspiciously as Dubois checked everything with a professional eye. Ace wasn't willing to trust Dubois further than she could throw him, since he seemed to use much the same methods as their enemies."
BNC-877,Jeff Dudley. The Edwardian informed me recently that he 'd been appointed trade attache in one of our Central American embassies.
BNC-88,"And what's the point? I know Elaine's name, I know where I was born - I can at least make a start."
BNC-882,Why had he left without a word to Miss Macdonald? It was unclear to what extent he had told his daughter anything about his movements.
BNC-883,"He thought of ringing Frances, but something deterred him. She had spoken of meeting the following weekend and going down to Juliet's."
BNC-885,``Well...'' But did they want it to bother him?
BNC-886,"As he lived in Bethnal Green, it was, but so was Hackney. Bunny, Martin and the other two girls decided to go for a meal in a Swedish restaurant Bunny said he knew in Lisson Grove, the Dead Zone between the Edgware Road and Lord's Cricket Ground."
BNC-891,Why else would a senior French policeman come all the way from Paris to see Puddephat's wife? The Oxford police must have interviewed her several times already.
BNC-892,"A stop must be put to it. And where did Emma get off, calling her only brother a swine?"
BNC-895,Freaks. Perhaps because she 'd dressed them for winter?
BNC-899,"I didn't really like the way the other boys treated him. I was new at the school and still observing, still beginning friendships."
BNC-900,He would get the film. He would draw the money out of the bank this time.
BNC-901,"It was as if they realised that she was not for the rough and tumble of this world, like the aggressive women with shaggy hair styles who pushed their way through life thrusting their hard shopping baskets at defenceless men. The man who had offered the seat had seen Ianthe as a tall fragile-looking woman in a pretty blue hat that matched her eyes."
BNC-902,He was in Radio Times as a strip cartoon for eight years and his portrait has hung in the Royal Academy. This book is intended not only for present-day children but also for all who have ever enjoyed the Captain's adventures.
BNC-903,I had decided that I had to have a partial confidant at the school. One did not have to attend school meals with the boys over the week-end if one was off duty.
BNC-904,And I was excited by my new importance. Proud and pleased to be playing opposite Frank Donovan who had once stood in for Hayden Coffin.
BNC-908,``And you're wrong about us. We're not children and I 'd say we're learning the rules pretty quickly.''
BNC-911,"Cecilia always left coming to Tina's until noon was past because she did not want to find her daughter in bed. Had she done so she would not have said a word, would not have looked a word, would simply have sat on the bed and talked to Tina for ten minutes instead of the two of them sitting opposite each other in armchairs."
BNC-917,His flat was on the top floor. Underneath was a dentist and on the ground floor an estate agent.
BNC-92,That's why he's locked up. I don't want him to know we 've got divers aboard and I especially don't want him to see me taking off with divers in the general direction of the Delos.
BNC-923,"I could see that if I were to give way to retroscendence the average supermarket gondola, stuck with myriad products like a hedgehog with spines, would become a mystic test-bed able through its thousand portals to suck me into individual sagas so complex, so durable, that I would perhaps never reemerge. The very ecosystem I inhabited was also to be one of products, striving against built-in obsolescence to individuate themselves, using whatever human means were at their disposal to advance their branded species."
BNC-927,Patrick poured a whisky for himself too. He was less detached than she thought.
BNC-939,"When he was there we were Bonnie and Clyde, now he was gone we were Blondie and Dagwood. Or rather, now he was gone, I was Dennis."
BNC-94,"Nothing yet. Except that I will not detain you in prison or expel you from Scotland, on one condition."
BNC-941,It was drink that got me into this mess. That and the club raffle.
BNC-946,"``Give me more time,'' replies Rufus. But he knows this is part of the game."
BNC-947,"For a while the notion gripped him, and he prowled the many floors of Hamleys looking for toys. He bought a magic set for Sebastian (although his ideal present for the kid would have been a brand-new name) and a marionette for Louise."
BNC-954,"I spent just over an hour with Patterson which, I found out later, turned out to be another first. Time is money in the City and few people are worth an hour unless it's over lunch and only then if you're involved in a takeover bid."
BNC-957,"She would shake her head and deftly speak of other matters, though never about her father's past. Now, I knew some French."
BNC-963,"The Deputy Under Secretary could talk of his host's prospects and disappointments, he could learn of the problems of digging out foreign exchange and hard currency in the Third World, the tribulations over the renewal of Residence Permits, the difficulties of keeping reliable servants, but of his own world he must remain silent. The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef... No bloody way."
BNC-967,I WAS really only a bystander in the tragedy of young Mr and Mrs McLeod.
BNC-971,Only much later did it occur to her that this was her failure. Academically self-sufficient and wholly self-centred she saw their sullenness and ignorance as their concern and their fault.
BNC-972,She stood lighting a cigarette and looking at my mother out of the corners of her eyes. My mother was again plunged into a version of that dilemma common to all divorced wives.
BNC-973,"My mother was again plunged into a version of that dilemma common to all divorced wives. Either she could say that Derek was the biggest fool the world had ever seen - in which case she would stand, self-confessed, as an even bigger fool for having married him in the first place."
BNC-978,"Hazel had not felt so much bewildered since Blackberry had talked about the raft beside the Enborne. Obviously, the stones could not possibly be anything to do with El-ahrairah."
BNC-979,"Then they would awake, terrified and sweating, to find themselves in white starched linen, in a comfortable bed, in peaceful England. And all would be well."
BNC-980,Paula could not help herself. It was just the way she was.
BNC-986,Nobody noticed. It wasn't hard to sneak a copy of the tutor's program and take it back to her room.
BNC-989,"He was a friend of Sergei Rozanov. She liked Sergei a lot, had fancied him like mad when they 'd first met, at the house of mutual acquaintances in Moscow."
BNC-996,"Clare wondered why she felt so hurt, when she 'd always known the truth. Sam was a movie creature, first and foremost."
SWBD-1,"A: Some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict. B: Yeah, I understand."
SWBD-10,"B: Especially if they're found guilty of the crime. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, once they have been arrested"
SWBD-100,"A: I think that it went up a thousand percent on most, B: Yeah. That's incredible but they had to, uh, go in the direction of a market driven economy, and they had to bite the bullet for that. So that's a good move, on Gorbachev's part in doing that. A: Uh-huh. B: So, A:"
SWBD-101,A: How do you feel about gun control? B:
SWBD-102,"A: Okay. So Frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have? B:"
SWBD-103,"B: I don't know how my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. He worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. But we did okay. We had a house and a home and, but now, my wife and I both work"
SWBD-104,"B: I think they should be randomly drug tested. A: Yeah. B: I believe, full force in that. A: Yeah. B:"
SWBD-105,"A: Well, how do you feel about the immigration laws? B: At, currently, I think they are a little restrictive. Uh, particularly for, uh, certain ethnic groups or from certain countries. Um, I think we should permit, uh, more immigration from eastern Europe, for example, uh, particularly uh, the Jewish, uh, uh, people from Russia. I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years. And, I think we have, uh, uh, too much restriction uh, on the Orientals also, but, of course, that's just my opinion. A: Yeah,"
SWBD-106,"A: He's in here somewhere, I know he is. B: Right. A: Yeah. Well, I know how to use one. we go hunting every once in a while and he showed me how to use his guns and I really enjoy it"
SWBD-107,"B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something."
SWBD-108,"A: As a freshman? B: Yeah. A: Yep. B: And, uh, he's pleased with his classes."
SWBD-109,"B: I really never had anything major with my Mazda but it was a standard also and the clutch went out on it toward the end, I had it five years and the last two years it seemed to go out really easily. I think it went out twice in two years and that's a lot it shouldn't go out that much. A: Huh-uh. B: And so I went ahead and bought another standard when I bought the Honda"
SWBD-11,"B: Well, yeah, use that or, you know, there's other consequences rather than killing them, you know, you could, always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against. A: Oh.  Huh-uh. B: You know. A: Yeah. B: At least they might get some benefit in that,"
SWBD-110,"A: Oh, well, what kind of paint did you use for the, um, bookends? B: Well, that's half the problem right there is that it was a oil base, so I had to get, and when I painted them, I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house. So I had it all over my hands. At first I didn't realize, you know, I had never painted anything,"
SWBD-111,"A: But, uh, my only complaint is I really don't enough time to look at the articles every day and go through a paper, you know, exhaust the details. So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines. B: Do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like? A: Well, yes."
SWBD-112,"A: It was really kind of interesting because, Arsenio was asking him about, uh, what he thought of, uh, one of the other action guys. B: Really. A: God, I can't even remember the name. He said well, he wouldn't really talk about it."
SWBD-113,"A: Not that they won't appoint them but there is no budget for them, I guess. and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the uh, court clerks. B: Huh.  Yeah. Whatever. A: So it seems, uh, no,"
SWBD-114,"B: it's just a great cat, but. A: Well, my personal preference is a dog."
SWBD-115,"A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah."
SWBD-116,"A: Oh, oh yeah, and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat. B: Uh-huh. A: And you go crazy thinking it might be yours. B: Right,"
SWBD-117,"B: until they're older and then they look back. A: Yeah, it's true, um. what are some other questions they have, I'm not sure. I know my parents are growing up, I guess they never spent much time watching TV."
SWBD-118,"B: Oh, it does. Uh, I have four sons myself, and the youngest is twenty-eight. So they are all pretty well grown up and they all went through it, you know, going through high school and everything and knock wood that, uh, they have not,"
SWBD-119,"A: Uh, I, the cynical side of me says that, you know, it was more for, uh, the domestic political situation than for anything else. You know, you know, and for portraying Bush is a strong President. B: Huh, yeah, okay.  Sure. A: Uh, I mean my gut feeling is that, you know, he pretty much picked the fight uh, with, um, Hussein. B: Uh-huh. A:"
SWBD-12,"B: And other than that I do not think it should be allowable. I think it should be illegal for them to want to do that. it's kind of the big brother syndrome, I mean, I just, anything like that just kind of scares me. A: I tend to view it, even though I don't think I'd work for a company that did that, I sort of want to defend an employer's rights uh, in addition to an individual's rights, but an employer, really, I think, has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to B: Right. A:"
SWBD-120,"B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective. A: Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also."
SWBD-121,"B: Uh-huh. Yeah, I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal. I think people need to understand more like what a meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just get used to using all the terms. Because someone says a kilogram, no one knows what that is. A: Everyone wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a concept to hold in mind. B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-122,"A: so you hear so much, you get a little tired of it, but then again, so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day, maybe B: Yep. A: but I think the quality of uh, our news is just, uh,"
SWBD-123,"A: I've never heard that one, that's very nice. Oh, so I'm all for the metric system and converting over and I think, I guess, my feeling is the way to do it is to just start giving weights, you know, have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers, er, just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and, uh, just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert. Remember me getting a package of something that said one pound, this is a package of dates mind you, was, presumably something you weigh fairly precisely, it said one pound and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fifty-four point six grams. B: Right, right. A: And, as near as I could tell, seeing that was basically anti-metric propaganda cause anyone who would say, well look I can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty-four point six grams which, of course, they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway, um, every time I see something like that I think, well, that's an anti-metric argument. B: Yeah."
SWBD-124,"A: Okay, looks like we're ready to go. Capital punishment, uh, the problem I have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime, but I don't think that it really actually does that."
SWBD-125,"A: No, I had moved away. B: No, uh-huh. A: I had taken the first one back."
SWBD-126,"A: and I'm just like, well, uh, I'm not even going to think much about it if you're going to treat me with this much respect even before you've gotten to know me. B: Yeah.  Right.  Right. that's basically my opinion on it, right there, is that it's just, you know, I was in the same sort of situation as, it was a job interview and then you had a physical, where you were drug tested, and it's, I just, and I know people who have been drug tested and who have not, you know, been hired by a corporation which, uh, you know, I really. The other side of it is, besides its being an invasion of personal privacy, it's my bodily fluid and I don't really want you to look at it, or something pretty basic like that, A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-127,"B: And I've worked in the hospital for fifteen years and I've taken care of a few AIDS patients. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, when they asked us did we want to, uh, keep it the same or, uh, spend more, spend less, uh, I think right now what they're spending is adequate. Uh, for my personal opinion. Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-128,"A: I'll let you go first. B: Oh, well, what's there to say? Doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion."
SWBD-129,"A: See those type of people that have the most opinions, ones that don't know anything. B: Yeah. A: Well, uh, I've had teenagers and I now have grandchildren that are teenagers,"
SWBD-13,"A: Yeah, they did. They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside. Uh, it's funny watching them play, he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks, uh, when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best. B: Uh-huh. A: And I haven't quite figured that out,"
SWBD-130,"A: Um, yeah, that's for sure. That's for sure, do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see? B: Well, it lo-, o-, the one trend I would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers, there are fewer of them home in the afternoons, A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-131,"A: Okay, looks like we're ready to go. Capital punishment, uh, the problem I have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime,"
SWBD-132,"A: Well, do you think it's, should be illegal for an employer to do this or, B: Uh, I really think it should be, except as I've mentioned twice now, in the specified industries or jobs, because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times. A: Yeah. B:"
SWBD-133,"A: Uh, well then you must know a lot more about this than I do. B: Uh, I think, uh, the system right now, you know, you know, is fine. I think it should be by a jury. I don't think the judge should have, I mean he's just there kind of like the referee. A: Uh-huh, Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-134,"B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know, I don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety-seven cents a week. A: No, no, not at all. B:"
SWBD-135,"B: How about Ghost? A: we saw, an, we liked it"
SWBD-136,"B: Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it, you know, uh, the go ahead to do it. A: Yeah. B: Because he had the fu-, he knew what was going to happen, more than any of us."
SWBD-137,"B: Oh, she was just funny. A: Really? B: She was really funny. And her character was good."
SWBD-138,"B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use."
SWBD-139,"A: Yes. And, oh, yeah, it's very expensive. B: Oh. A: And, uh, B:"
SWBD-14,"B: Then I have another daughter in, uh, Bountiful, Utah and she has to work full-time and it's just tearing her apart. She has a private baby-sitter. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, the baby just screams. I mean, the baby is like seventeen months and she just screams. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-140,"A: and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing, people could have got a raise. So, see, you know, there's different, I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a yes, sir, we should have drug testing because there's really a problem B: Uh-huh. A: and I know that. But then, I have other views to it. B:"
SWBD-141,"A: and that rolling kind of, uh, B: Terrain. A: Yeah. is fairly famili-,. The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics, apparently it's going to win everything. B: Really? A:"
SWBD-142,"B: I did, too. A: I mean, it was just more for my money. B: Yeah."
SWBD-143,"B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it."
SWBD-144,"B: Uh-huh, uh-huh. How's that? I haven't seen that. A: I like it a lot. It's real different."
SWBD-145,"A: I don't think it's done. I don't think we run it as a deterrent. I mean people say that, but, I mean, if it was really a deterrent, I mean I think like horse thieves in the old west, you know, they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while. B: Uh-huh. A: And if it was really seriously going to be a deterrent, I would think that it would be public."
SWBD-146,"B: but, you know, for other kind of cans, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they. A: Yeah, I don't, yeah,"
SWBD-147,"B: Uh, if they've got these bins for all the other little items, I'm sure if people will have batteries, uh, you know, quite often to toss out. A: Right, that's true. "
SWBD-148,"B: That throws the budget out of whack real fast. A: Well, we actually planned for about one year. B: Oh, good. A:"
SWBD-149,"B: yeah, obviously we don't have any and I think that's part of the role reversal, is it's okay to get married and not have kids. A: Oh yeah. B: And I think society for such a long time said, well, you know, you're married, now you need to have your family"
SWBD-15,"A: it's nice when it makes, a lot because you can feed your own family. And then, B: Yeah, because when I make this chicken casserole it makes a real big casserole and then another one that I freeze. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-150,"B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah. "
SWBD-151,"A: Well, uh, and that's an idea that's been kicked around for a long time."
SWBD-152,"A: No, I don't either. B: Uh, I mean it's, you know it, A:"
SWBD-153,"B: But, uh, if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the State of Wisconsin, as a matter of fact, uh, started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-154,"A: I suppose so. Let me push the button. B: All right. A: Okay, uh, I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system, but, uh, I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon. B: Yeah,"
SWBD-155,"A: for the moment, and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying, I am going to give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November, and you'll elect me again B: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. A: and then I'm going to go on and just forget everything that I said B: Uh-huh. A:"
SWBD-156,"B: Yeah. Well, that's the guy that counts. A: Yes. But, maybe we'll get your guy. B:"
SWBD-157,"A: Uh, such like, maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees. The other thing that juries are restricted on and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things even in my own experiences, that you usually don't get to hear all the information. B: Yeah. A: It's what information is presented"
SWBD-158,"B: Well, that's true. A: I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is, uh, uh, there ought to be a"
SWBD-159,"A: Yeah, but that, doesn't mean, B: But that doesn't eliminate it, does it? A:"
SWBD-16,"B: anybody tries to hurt them I won't even blink, A: I know,  No. I understand that."
SWBD-160,"A: Oh, I can't either, not a one. B: And I know at least in the medical field, it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-161,"B: Yeah. How about Mister Rogers, is he still around? A: Yes. Yeah. They still show Mister Rogers."
SWBD-162,"A: What do you think about Robin Hood? B: Well, I work for school district and, uh, it has hurt us a lot. Uh, there has to be some way, I think, to equalize education opportunities. But, uh, you know, I think, especially big government, tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it. And I don't, you know, that's just not true."
SWBD-163,"B: like the customer is always right and you know, no matter how crabby you might be over the phone, they are very understanding and, uh, they ma- make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise. A: That's really good. It use to be like that. B: Uh-huh. A: But, "
SWBD-164,"B: That sounds really good. I read a thing, I don't even remember if it was in the Dallasite or the Insite one, about uh, companies allowing you, and they said that TI was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. Which I thought sounded like a good idea. You know, if you've been there, you know, under five years you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying, okay, I'm going to want an extra five days this year and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know, and they're deducting it all along, so you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time, you know, you're really not being paid for them, the money is actually coming out of your own pocket, but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know. So, that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and TI said that they were looking into something like that so, A: Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time for overtime. B: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. A:"
SWBD-165,"B: and I'm just here for the rest of the stay. And so you know, I guess most of the time when I think about somebody going into a nursing home, it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs. Yeah A: Uh-huh. B: they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore. Uh, I know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home. They generally were able to have someone care for them at home and they died. But they were all, goodness, younger than your grandparents. Like they were in their eighties. That type of thing. Uh, but I did, uh, you know, I guess, uh, when I think nursing home I do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically. Uh, A:"
SWBD-166,"B: Yeah, and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it. A: No, not when you figure,"
SWBD-167,"A: Uh, at, uh, it's TCJC. Tarrant County Junior College. B: Oh. A: Yeah. B: Okay. A: And it's really enjoyable. I like it. And then they also, you know, do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption,"
SWBD-168,"A: Yeah, that's crazy. B: and then you come here in the Dallas area, um,"
SWBD-169,"A: But, I mean, uh, is that a reflection then of what is really happening in the real world? If they keep giving everybody hundred year sentences,"
SWBD-170,"B: but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now, in five years, when they get bigger, it'll work a little bit more, too. A: Yeah.  True. B: Because it's, we've all got to do it right now. I just, I really amazed to find out that, eighty per cent are filled now, in garbage fills. In five years we're supposed to be at max. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-171,"A: Yeah. Koontz. Uh, his last name ends in a Z, I know that. B: Yeah, oh, I think I know who you're talking about. Uh, I've seen,"
SWBD-172,"A: Is, uh, kind of fun. It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now. And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal. Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet,. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have."
SWBD-173,"B: I think I've been trout fishing once. I've never fly fished. Have you fly fished? A: Uh, no I haven't."
SWBD-174,"B: If you compare like the people that could have sent their kids to private schools and you know, the people that, uh, did send their kids to private schools. A: Yes. B: I think they compare you know, fairly well. A: Yeah. Yeah."
SWBD-175,"A: And, uh, I got to stay home with my kids, which I really wanted to do, but now I could not go back and do it. B: Yeah. A: I really couldn't,"
SWBD-176,"A: Yeah. Well, Do you have anything else to say? B: Well,  No, not too much more about credit cards. A: Okay."
SWBD-177,"B: Well that's true. You're right, you know, by the time you've finally got down to it, I was hoping I could remember where all those other things went. A: Well that's kind of the way I was, I tried to remember as I took stuff off where it went,"
SWBD-178,"A:  nanny, sort of? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: and you know, I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting, uh, uh, story or whatever. A: Yeah. B:"
SWBD-179,"A: They might, they're actually very friendly dogs. B: Are they really?"
SWBD-18,"B: Yeah, hormones, but yeah, uh, steroids. But, I stay from that crap. A: Yeah, it's too dangerous. B:"
SWBD-180,"B: That was kind of a funny movie with, uh, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray. A: Uh-huh. B: That was fun. A: Golly,"
SWBD-181,"A: when I started thinking about this, those are some of my favorite shows, McGyver, because it's only one person there, uh, you know, instead of a cast of people, B: Uh-huh. A: but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap, and grabbing what he can and, you know, pieces of baling wire and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and, B:"
SWBD-182,"B: uh, those Cowboys have increased their prices again this year. A: Oh yeah. B: But I didn't know,"
SWBD-183,"B: Yeah. How about you? A: Oh, uh, I'm very varied as well."
SWBD-184,"A: Um, I don't, I am only twenty-eight and I haven't had much experience with nursing homes. I have never visited any of them"
SWBD-185,"A: so it's nice to get away. It's just amazing, how much you miss. B: Yeah, it,  Yeah, it, yeah, it really is."
SWBD-186,"B: You never see them on nationally basketball. A: You know, that's true."
SWBD-187,"A: That's not too bad. Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too, they're kind of like, get that permanent smile to them, B: Yeah, right. A: they're always happy."
SWBD-188,"B: Yeah. It's, uh, I have modem night computer so I can log into the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which can be useful. But, uh, yeah that and word processing is while I tend to, I mean, obviously, I do almost all of my report writing on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess. I can't even remember,"
SWBD-189,"B: Well, I know I'm in the, you know, the only reason I asked about secondary schools or, you know, advanced education is because down here, you know, going to the University of Texas, the education I'm getting I think is kind of shoddy for a public school. A: Is it? B:"
SWBD-19,"A: I am right outside Baltimore. I am less than a mile from the Baltimore line. B: Um. A: And I go to a campus of the University of Maryland that is just, less than a mile from my house. So I'm actually in Baltimore, yeah,"
SWBD-190,"A: But it seems to me uh, that the budget is so out of hand, and especially now that they say, Okay, the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend you know of X number of billion, trillion dollars a year. B: Uh-huh. A: Well, I'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go,"
SWBD-191,"A: Well, actually, uh, A:"
SWBD-192,"A: Well, uh, uh, do you ever use the ATM machines? B: No, I never do. My husband does at work just to get cash out, but, uh, I take the checkbook so if I need cash, I just tell him and he gets it out"
SWBD-193,"A: so it's nice to get away. It's just amazing, how much you miss. B: Yeah, it,  Yeah, it, yeah, it really is. I mean, I don't think I ever see the Little Dipper, you hear people talk about the Little Dipper. A: Huh. Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-194,"A: And I don't think that's right. I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system. B: Oh, likewise. A:"
SWBD-195,"B: Now see I. A: I'm intrigued by it, but I'm not sure I want to go see it yet. B: Yeah,"
SWBD-196,"A: I'm like, I'll get a job some day and my boss will pay for it, I'll be needed. B: Yeah. A: Because, um, I didn't want to go do it myself"
SWBD-197,"A: Do you go to museums in Europe? B: Uh, actually, no,"
SWBD-198,"B: I remember I went to see Don Quixote over there when it came out. It came out right around the time, with Sophia Loren and that was a riot to see that. A: You know something,"
SWBD-199,"A: I guess it, would, B: Because you got to, watch them every day, and keep them watered A: yeah.  Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-2,"B: I wouldn't be surprised. A: You know, because they don't want to send them to daycare. B:"
SWBD-20,"A: That is the way to do it. I mean, and that's, you know, at least the Air Force is, I do not know, uh, I am nervous in Dallas. I mean, you know, I mean, I go to like an aerobics class or something. And, you know, uh, seventy women in a Jazzercise class in a public, uh, parks and rec building. And you are supposed to feel safe, but then there are all these, does not matter race, but, you know, it is an inter racial mix. And you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards. B: Yeah. A: And I do not even think that way, but I mean, you just think to yourself, you just, I mean,"
SWBD-200,"A: But, uh, uh, I don't understand, I guess, why the schools seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities. B: Uh, well, I don't pretend to understand that either. Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better. So, uh, the other two a-, they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways. And clearly, to me, is a kind of government thing to fix but it's just like, I don't expect them to know which part is best to fix just like I don't know. it's a complicated issue."
SWBD-201,"B: She says that when her husband died oh, that my uncle had said that he would never put her in a rest home. So it's kind of, uh, I don't know. I mean, I don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed and, it's, A: Uh-huh. B: and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so it gets, I don't know. it's a hard decision,"
SWBD-202,"A: yeah, it's kind of l-, B: It was kind of funny. They were doing some, uh, ozone testing, uh, the EPA and they were just screening some candidates,"
SWBD-203,"A: Big time there, sure is. B: It surely is. A:"
SWBD-204,"B: So did I. My Masters, anyway. A: What, but, uh, when I look at it to me, uh, it doesn't really make any difference. It was a marvelous opportunity that I couldn't have done,"
SWBD-205,"B: and, uh, that then ends up being the most common example for me. A: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. B: Um, I guess I'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this one that you raised. A: Yeah. B:"
SWBD-206,"A: Well, presumably those who find out such information, if they are doing it, I would prefer to not to be known, and, I mean, you know, the classic, oh, I don't know C I  conspiracy theories or whatever, would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge. So there's,, things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it, and I can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia. It's a surmise and, I'd like to think that it's quite low, at least in this country. B: to surmise. It is there. A:"
SWBD-207,"B: Well, uh, I myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in this, uh, very specific examples such as, uh, transportation workers, as in, uh, air traffic controllers, bus drivers and that kind of thing. A: Well. B: Um, I don't really think that it's, uh, too many, I think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say, well, we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're, uh, you know, worthy of working for us. I really don't see that that's a very valid, uh, thing for a company to say,"
SWBD-208,"A: and I'm saying to myself, well, you know, you dump your little turnip off to, uh, you know, this child care place and they don't pay very much and why would they be interested in your little turnip unless, you know, one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, that's a terrible kind of thing"
SWBD-209,"B: That might be kind of tough, huh. A: It really would, yes, yes, and like I said, my sister's still in it,"
SWBD-21,"B: Uh, yes. Well, they find it is more deterrent. A: Well, my sociology class at SMU's taught us that it was not a deterrent. Uh, but now that's just what they said. Uh, I don't know"
SWBD-210,"A: and they kind of are in different spectrums, I think. Um, one of them is Quantum Leap B: Okay. A: and the other one is Night Court. And I think they're real different"
SWBD-211,"B: I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. A: Right.  And then do it all over again.  Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-212,B: I'll give it that. It is fun to play. If you don't value your very much. A: You've played it then? B:
SWBD-213,"B: Oh, well that's good. A: but she really doesn't."
SWBD-214,"A: My husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation. She'll let something slip and we'll say, wait a minute. and that's it, she, just, well I didn't want to bother you."
SWBD-215,"B: Uh, do you feel that yours is invaded? A: Uh, no I wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means. Uh, you know, I would, there's a lot of times though, uh, you get those calls you know, when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or whatnot and, you know, next thing you know, uh, someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to tell them, you know, that you're not interested. Or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you, you know, and keep badgering you about it, and that aggravates me."
SWBD-216,"B: What am I afraid of? A: Yes. B: Um, I don't know if I'm really afraid of spending too much."
SWBD-217,"A: That's fairly interesting. B: I bet that would be, rather interesting. Uh, that's, uh, self improvement, well, that's kind of a hobby but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing, uh. A: Yeah,"
SWBD-218,"A: So that's not too bad. B: No, uh, I really think that, here in Indiana at least we pay uh, just too much tax. I worked in a factory, uh, last summer and, on the average, I was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes"
SWBD-219,"B: They're seen as senile. A: and oh, the old-timer made with the old way and nobody respects the traditions. And, you know, it's"
SWBD-22,"A: They might be, but not at the human factors level. they're, B: Well, I heard it on the news today,"
SWBD-220,"A: You know, violent crimes uh, with just malicious intent. B: Right, exactly. Yeah. Well, you know, that's exactly"
SWBD-221,"A: But, uh, B: Okay.  Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times"
SWBD-222,"B: there's, and you just miss the little things, A: Yeah. B: and, uh, A:"
SWBD-223,"A: Not that they won't appoint them but there is no budget for them, I guess. and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the uh, court clerks. B: Huh.  Yeah. Whatever. A: So it seems, uh, no, I do not think I would change it."
SWBD-224,"B: And other than that I do not think it should be allowable. I think it should be illegal for them to want to do that. it's kind of the big brother syndrome, I mean, I just, anything like that just kind of scares me. A: I tend to view it,"
SWBD-225,"B: And, uh, the injector pump went bad so I found a outfit down here to rebuild it. And, uh, reinstalled that B: and that was probably one of the most miserable things I had gotten into in a long time. A:"
SWBD-226,"B: Little Mermaid and Peter Pan I think are his two favorites that we've got. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. And I think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video, uh, Shipwrecked. B:"
SWBD-227,"B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know."
SWBD-228,"B: I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right? A: Yes. B: And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home? A:"
SWBD-229,"B: Oh, you found that out tonight? A: Yeah. B: I haven't even heard that, that's great. I think he deserves every penny of it. A: Yeah. B:"
SWBD-23,"A: Yeah, that's true., but, uh, I think, I mean even more than that, even, I mean if you drop out in high school you should still be able to read, you know? Which, I mean it sounds like, uh, B: Uh-huh.  Yeah. That's true. A:"
SWBD-230,A:
SWBD-231,"A: It's divided, yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, so we've got our Cowboys here"
SWBD-232,"B: he refuted it, it just was not effective enough to... A: Well, he didn't refute it til the last two weeks of the campaign."
SWBD-233,"B: Um, in fact, Los Alamos, uh, has, uh, done a fair amount of research, uh, in recycling things in general. Um, it involves, for instance, uh, creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like selenium, and barium and, uh, other things from, uh, waste material in general. uh, and purify the waste of specific, uh, uh, nasty elements. A: Well, that's pretty, uh, upscale, uh, trash, uh, uh, situation."
SWBD-234,"B: if you get it on sale, A: Yeah, yeah, so we bought that or we bought the filets, and then the chicken, or turkey nuggets,"
SWBD-235,"B: Well, that's the same thing that I did. I hope I'll be able to do the same with grandchildren. A: I think that once you do that, your children kind of develop the same attitudes. At least my daughters have. They try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up. So it's worked pretty well. There's,"
SWBD-236,"A: And it's brought the, they, uh, really listen to the, uh, lobbyist and, uh, the car manufacturing companies uh, you know, have really pushed, they, all those restrictions are really too hard, we can't quite make that go and they don't and then we still live with air pollution. B: Yeah. A: Um, so I suspect that that's one thing that as individuals, we can do, make our voices known, perhaps to our legislators. But, um, as a society, I think we can do more and that's probably how we ought to do it. Uh, being individually responsible in order to be group responsible. B: Yeah,"
SWBD-237,"A: Have you followed that very much or, B: Uh, not really."
SWBD-238,"B: All right, well. A:"
SWBD-239,"B: And, I, we're big broccoli fans. A: Uh-huh that's what I've got. I've got steamed broccoli down on mine. B:"
SWBD-24,"B: I'm not sure I want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision. Uh, I mean, that doesn't sound right. Um, I guess I see overall beneficial, if we're going from that point of view. A: Uh-huh. B: Um. you know, in the past, I don't know how old you are, but when I was, uh, in high school, it was the beginning of Vietnam and so forth. And many of my peers were being drafted. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-240,"B: Right. Well, for instance, does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her and she came up negative. A: Well, no, I don't think they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I didn't, I mean, B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-241,"B: So did you commute everyday then or, A: No. B: Oh, okay. A: No, no, it was a six hour drive. B: Oh, okay,"
SWBD-242,"A: but the thing is, that, um. B: Well, especially being a college student your,"
SWBD-243,"A: Oh, yes. Animals have a way of talking. B: Alfie did. I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day. A:"
SWBD-244,"A: And somebody said, well, you know, you could go in and substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day and there's always going to be, you know, somebody having a need for a math or science teacher. I thought, Christ, they're letting me in, to, you know, B: Yeah. A: this would be frightening. I don't know anything about it. B:"
SWBD-245,"A: but at the same time I think it would do them a world of good. B: Yeah. A: But there's a, B:"
SWBD-246,"A: Is, uh, kind of fun. It's best done when you have leisure time and I had more of that in my childhood days than I have now. And I grew up in an area that, uh, was just a few feet from a rather large lake, and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal. Uh, I worked for a camp for a number of years. My father was on staff there, and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats, you name it, they had it and we did a lot of, water sports. But I think, uh, the thing I liked the best was, uh, we spent about a summer couple of guys, uh, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid-thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four- foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves, or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it. If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up. It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, uh, upright again. This one you had to work with. You get out of the water again and get it upright. And, uh, sailing was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the wind, as it were, tacking back and forth and, uh, more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and, uh, the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing and as soon as the front came over, it was calm. So you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away. And that didn't always work. We oftentimes got wet. But, uh, it's a nice hobby to have. Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore, so things change, I guess. What are your memories of boating, or current, B: Uh, about the only memories that I have of boating, uh, my husband's family had a motor boat, uh, when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times. And, uh, I really did enjoy that."
SWBD-247,"A: That's right, that's right. B: Uh, I don't have other than a reading and male perspective on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not. Uh, my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent."
SWBD-248,"A: you know, then, we thought, well we can use it for, you know, some personal things. We di-, for us it really took, you know, a business application to justify the expense of it. B: Uh-huh.  Oh, definitely, definitely. I know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer, oh, I guess, probably three years ago for Christmas, and, you know, it's got some stuff on it. It's got a nice little word processing software on it, you know, and some budgeting type things and stuff."
SWBD-249,"A: Yeah. Now that's a very good suggestion. B: Uh, just something to, i-, rather than throw someone into that environment, uh, you know, it A: Yeah."
SWBD-25,"A: I got a friend who goes there, by the way. I want to talk to you about that afterward, okay. B: Okay. Uh, I've, the high school I went to uh, was a good one also."
SWBD-250,"A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. Yeah,"
SWBD-251,"A: Yeah, I had a friend whose brother did steroids and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out. It all turned to fat and he just, really looked bad. B: Really.  Ugh. A: But, uh, B:"
SWBD-252,"A: And now it's election time again so they're trying to lower them. B: Oh. A: So they're just talk about lowering them but they never do, they just keep raising them. B:"
SWBD-253,"B: Yeah, I mean, there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else. A: Right, you know, they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat. But,, I'm wondering if there's another issue here, and maybe this is why this has died out. Can you go into, and this wasn't the question but it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults, can they go in there and can anyone go well, out of the Kurdish community is a little bit extreme at this time, but say, I think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and it doesn't do any good. B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-254,"A: Well, where you're located, I do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing. B: Uh-huh. A: And I think they've had it for several years."
SWBD-255,"B: they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do. A: Yes.  Yeah. Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful. And then, I wondered if people were unwilling"
SWBD-256,"B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. I don't know if I I'm yeah, in favor of, yeah, A:"
SWBD-257,"A: That, so that's, and I don't know, you know, I think about, well, the dress code they have for the kids, you know. Are they put one on the parents, or the teachers and say the men have to wear ties and there can be no blue jeans worn and, because some of the teachers I know wear, uh, dress up jeans, not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, you know, they'll wear it with a nice top."
SWBD-258,"B: I, think because they were scheduling a video release of it in July and then when it won all those awards, uh, they pushed it back to August, so. But, yeah, that one is definitely worth seeing, it's really good. A: Now did you see, uh, Driving Miss Daisy? B: Yeah,"
SWBD-259,"A: and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and you know, put another gallon of glass bottle in there. B: Yeah. A: So, uh, yeah, B: So, uh, you know, I look back at, uh, my childhood and I'd say, you know, they were doing things then that we should be doing now"
SWBD-26,"B: Right. And they repacked the wheel bearings. A: and they repacked the the wheel bearings. Yeah but, uh, I've had considerable experience."
SWBD-260,"A: you know, you create a bigger family, generation after generation but not really on purpose. B: Yeah. A: So. It's not a real functional situation anyway."
SWBD-261,"A: and, uh, I was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the EP  and lots of different places B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste. B:"
SWBD-262,"A: now we had one, this was before I lost a lot more of my family, but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway. Because I didn't have any of them left. B: Uh-huh. A: But, um, they had, uh, uh, thing where everybody could come and meet and go out to eat. B: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. A:"
SWBD-263,"A: But like I said if I voted for Bush, or like when, uh, Gary Hart was running, a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking, B: Hart?  Uh-huh. A: not that I think he was good looking, but, he was young. B: Yeah.  Yeah. A:"
SWBD-264,"A: I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway. B: Yeah. Well, the last two I saw him in, one of those Back To The Future, Part Three deals and that was crummy also."
SWBD-265,"B: It was good. The only thing I thought, um, that I haven't been trying, is when I, you know, go to take a shower, to save the water, and to put it on my plants. Which I had never thought about before. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: But I've already gone to, oh I started years ago, I guess, not years ago, but, yeah I would say five years ago, turning off I mean my water faucet, in the sink when I brush my teeth. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-266,"B: Yeah, and EDS is very particular about this, hair cuts, A: Wow. B: I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair, no beards, you know, and just really detailed. A:"
SWBD-267,"A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty. A:"
SWBD-268,"B: I don't know that you could require everyone yeah, to do it for a whole year, or two years or something like that, A: Mandatory just like the draft.  No. B:"
SWBD-269,"B: I think in s-, and it, just would depend upon the circumstances and the extent of the abuse and if another alternative was available. A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Um.  Uh-huh. You know, now, I wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, I guess in Biblical times when they had punishment, if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family, then uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And I know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, I would feel that I had the right to get revenge on them"
SWBD-27,"B: I mean it was like you can't have, you know, such and such facial hair, no beards, you know, and just really detailed. A: I don't know that that would be a good environment to work in. I mean, I see, I am more, I don't know about anybody else,"
SWBD-270,"A: I work in the airline, marketing group. B: Oh. A: So, we do a lot of, B:"
SWBD-271,"A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage."
SWBD-272,"B: Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's right. A: But, uh, B:"
SWBD-273,"B: our land is in acres, our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is. A: Right.  Yeah, I agree with you. I don't think we should either even though I know there are benefits to the metric system,"
SWBD-274,"A: Yeah, when they, you know it was funny, I can remember, and my mother and I have talked about it, how important it was when I came home from school. B: Um. A: It wasn't really conversation, but there were always things that just tumbled out. B: Yes. A:"
SWBD-275,"A: So, I don't know I'm looking for a good year. I guess we're always looking for a good year. B: So, obviously though, do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the Super Bowl this year or who do you like to do that this year? A: Uh, no"
SWBD-276,"B: Uh, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think, and they were okay. I had a Pontiac once and I never had a problem with it, but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point and I had driven it a few times and I really did not feel that I would buy a Dodge just from, A: Um. B: well, actually, I had uh, a Dodge Omni at one point A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-277,"A: Well, because we finally negotiated that I was losing my mind, uh, he sleeps in the laundry room and then he goes out for the day. But this is a beautiful dog and he is wonderful with our little girls and he's, comes from a purebred line and there's nothing you could say bad about him, except that I was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle. B: Right.  Right. A: And this is huge. You know, course, when he runs around the yard, he just digs,"
SWBD-278,"A: Oh, it wasn't that good. B: Well, oh, from a woman's point of view it was very, uh, chauvinistic as far as women go. Uh, it was entertaining, but, yeah,"
SWBD-279,"A: Yeah. I hope. That's true. B: You know, I, that's the kind of people,"
SWBD-28,"B: Might be worth it for peace of mind. A: Oh, yeah. It is, it is."
SWBD-280,"B: everyone I talk to, they says, you know, it's real easy to say that. A: we didn't damage enough of their arsenal. We damaged most of it but we should have made sure we got everything. B: Yeah,"
SWBD-281,"B: And it will send out a flower spike. You will see them blooming now. It is a wildflower here, but you can get them in the nursery. A: I am looking for a pen. I want to write this down because, well, that is where I went this year. Because I waited too late to really plant stuff. But I did not know that these hyacinths, like I said, I do not know anything about plants."
SWBD-282,"A: And you also get a lot of, uh, juries are extremely, uh, and from what I hear, I have some friends who do expert witness testimony and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know, the prosecutor will want to, oh, I don't know show the mugging victim, you know, show the nice person he was and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that was, uh, you know, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corporation. let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that. B: Uh-huh. A: So, not, I mean, I'm, the problem is I can't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury, but I'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be, things like that. B: Ri-, "
SWBD-283,"A: uh, but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate, uh, that they might leave it to somebody else who, uh, has expertise in that. B: Right, I agree, too."
SWBD-284,"A: Boy that's scary, isn't it. B: Oh, can you imagine, because it happens in the middle of the night,"
SWBD-285,"B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more,"
SWBD-286,"B: That's true. A: uh, you know, to,"
SWBD-287,"B: I think that not only applies inside the public school system, but in society itself. there's been too much negative reinforcement. How much, like, the caught being good slips. How about, just the John Q citizen out there on the street? A: Yeah, well that's true. I think, really though, I mean, that's one thing that, I mean, my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked. But I really do try to use positive, uh, reinforcement with them at home, also. And it really helps. And I mean, they don't get spanked very often, but they do when they deserve it, you know. But, uh, I don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked. I mean, I think I wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child. But, you know, that's just my personal opinion, and that's not going to,"
SWBD-288,"B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, you talked before, about the school funding."
SWBD-289,"B: Yeah, I mean it's. True. Yeah. A: I think that's a lot more realistic. Uh, I think that we should be spending more time"
SWBD-29,"B: Might be worth it for peace of mind. A: Oh, yeah. It is, it is. You might even find somebody's been reporting on you and you didn't even know it."
SWBD-290,"B: Right, I think I've seen some statistics that say that, uh, it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life. A: Right because you've got all the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses. B: Right. A:"
SWBD-291,"B: Okay, I don't know, which end do we push but okay, A: Okay, well, um, let's see,"
SWBD-292,"A: I think so, I think, B: I really do. Oh, yeah, it's going to take, uh, you know,"
SWBD-293,"B: I feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and, uh, that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor can't afford it either, but, uh, I really feel like and I feel like, you know, I'm a middle class person income wise anyway and, uh, I get tired of supporting the whole country. A: Yeah, so do I. I mean, I'm middle class barely,"
SWBD-294,"B: Uh-huh. Well are you into that rock music, you know, all that druggy stuff and all that I mean? A: Well, uh. B: You know what I am saying I mean like they come on the stage and like, you know, you,"
SWBD-295,"A: How do you feel about that. B: I don't really, I more, I don't know about the government as much as, uh, the people, uh, I wouldn't consider to be a threat at all"
SWBD-296,"B: So the original question, do we think they're you know, a security threat? A: Yeah. B: Um, yes and no. A: Yeah, I can go with that answer too. The only yes I could go to is if uh, a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to a nuclear exchange, but I don't even see that occurring. Uh, because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to I guess. B: Um, no. "
SWBD-297,"B: Because too often, there can be extremism that hurts from any direction, regardless of whatever you're arguing or concerned about. A: Yeah.  Right. Yeah, I know, you're right, they would lobby that and I see that, and that's why, you know, I'm like, okay, what's my role in this thing,, you know, what's my part, B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-298,"A: yeah, getting a lot of breaks between quarters and that, and having a lot of vacation. B: Right.  it really, um, I don't think most of our teachers, now I'm not a teacher, I am a secretarial executive assistant,"
SWBD-299,"B: Well, that's I meant when I said the school. A: Yeah. I don't blame it on the teachers in the school. although I think that, I do know for a fact that some of the teachers that I know personally get paid an awful lot more than, well, they do quite well for themselves. B: Huh."
SWBD-3,"B: And, uh, I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, so I shopped around,"
SWBD-30,"B: That's what I've heard too. Uh, A: It seems bizarre to me."
SWBD-300,"A: And then he has backed out, he has pulled out. And I realize they're still saying, well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein, so why aren't you helping us? And you see, I think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation. B: I think it would too. A:"
SWBD-301,"B: I think the, uh, I think a lot of the commentators on, like the major networks, like right, it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on, but, um, it seems that, um, they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they, you know, report on the news. A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name. B: Yeah.  Yeah, exactly. A:"
SWBD-302,"B: I mean, you know, he's so messed up. A: Right. B: And, um, this was a nice, sweet, young man who, teenager, you know, and he's now a young man about twenty, I guess, who, um, just got really down the wrong path. A: Right. B:"
SWBD-303,"B: That was surprising to me. A: Um. B: I missed that question, totally, I mean really bad. I'm trying to think, I didn't miss too many, I can't remember what my score was, but I did exceeding well. I was surprised."
SWBD-304,"B: It's, uh, I don't know, I don't really liken it to alcohol but, yet that can be carried to an extreme, too. A: Uh-huh. B: So I think it's a good idea and I think just the idea you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're, A: Right. B:"
SWBD-305,"B: And it seems like when the winds blow, it goes right through you. It's really different from Utah's weather. I thought Utah was cold, but I think Iowa is a lot colder. A: Yeah, see, that's how it is in Texas, too because when it's cold, it's really cold. So, B: Yeah,"
SWBD-306,"B: And the long-range views are just kind of, become a thing of the past. A: Yeah you, B: And, uh, A:"
SWBD-307,"A: uh, that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal. B: That's true. That's true. A:"
SWBD-308,"B: If, uh, you've some kid uh, who's from a broken family, the schools are supposed to fill that void. It's gotten way beyond uh, you know, teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like, oh, were kind of traditionally the school's roles. A: Yeah.  Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A:"
SWBD-309,"B: Anyway, I dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody making a decision what to do with them. A: Um, yeah, I guess that's not an easy solution. there's no easy solution for that. B: Uh-huh. "
SWBD-31,"A: And, with just a curtain, of course, between us and, uh, B: Right. A: they revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth, and he was definitely,"
SWBD-310,"B: Is Texas one of them? A: Texas is not one of them see. So, I have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass. B: Yeah. No,"
SWBD-311,"A: Well, got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone there? B: No,"
SWBD-312,"A: and I guess I would like, I don't know, the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a crime problem either. B: Oh, really. A: No, you can't, they don't execute anybody in Britain or France and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either and they don't have the crime problems we do."
SWBD-313,"B: Well, you've got, well, any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such, A: Uh-huh. B: And they get out their little Mac tens, they get out their little uzis and they're going to fight with them. And it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm. If they want it they'll get it. I don't care if they've got to go down into New Mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border. Now my position, although, I have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon, anyway. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-314,"A: that's one difference. There really wasn't a lot of difference. B: I didn't,"
SWBD-315,"B: Although they've got, uh, Meals On Wheels, Which I understand is a really good, you know, way to handle that so that at least they eat. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh. So as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice. B: No,"
SWBD-316,"A: But, uh, B: Yeah, yeah.  But it was, yeah, just lots of little lakes and, of course, it was, you know, a little more expensive to live on the lake, but I just thought that was grand."
SWBD-317,"B: It's kind of neat. A: Yeah, what does a computer club do."
SWBD-318,"A: Do they have Highlands up there? B: Nope. A: Don't they? Well, this was a regular, uh, electronics store, you know. B: Uh-huh. A:"
SWBD-319,"B: Yeah, and it almost seems like in order to avoid, uh, some of the scandal, you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find, say in the Bobsy twins or, something like that. A: Right.  You know, I also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out."
SWBD-32,"A: Oh, you mean, uh, learning type, uh, yeah? I mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission. B: Yes. A: But, yeah,"
SWBD-320,"B: Uh, which I am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done. A: Uh-huh. Uh, yeah, uh, uh, I guess, I hate to see anyone die, uh B: Uh-huh. A:"
SWBD-321,"B: And they have said no. A: Yeah and then during the week you see these women, in the you know, just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore, you know. B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-322,"A: so I don't know if I wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test, because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion. B: Right. Well, for instance, does the company you worked for before have the right or do they have the ability to say, hey, we've already drug tested her and she came up negative. A: Well, no,"
SWBD-323,"B: Uh, with regard uh, to jury trials. I really feel as though, uh, uh, whatever system has been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the jurisprudence is, you know, based uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. And if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they could start going back and digging up all these cases uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards."
SWBD-324,"A: Where are you from? B: I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina. A: Oh, my goodness."
SWBD-325,"A: Oh, well, what kind of paint did you use for the, um, bookends? B: Well, that's half the problem right there is that it was a oil base, so I had to get,"
SWBD-326,"B: Right, you know, like In packaging A: Yeah. B: and, uh, you know, just goodness. A: Yeah,"
SWBD-327,"B: but, um, at least they all seem to have, uh, you know, people that monitor their, uh, medication intake and dining facilities, you know, go to the dining room and eat some good meals. A: Uh-huh. B: I know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in, I mean, very antisocial. Maybe it takes a while for them to say, okay, well I'll be with other people but, A: Adapt. B: Yeah,"
SWBD-328,"A: The one thing I sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes B: Yes. A: you know, it's not just a matter um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy, and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, and I wonder um, if the system works adequately in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion. B:"
SWBD-329,"A: They, probably not enough, but I'm sure I lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind, of what they're missing out on. B: Yeah, I think they're starting to realize, but I just don't think they have the resources, if you were to compare, uh, the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or Fax machines and cellular phones, and state of the art equipment that we are so used to."
SWBD-33,"B: The kind you have sounds very interesting, though. A: Well, um, they're really sweet dogs."
SWBD-330,"A: Yeah, that's true. B: But, I have been watching these houses go up and I don't, well, somebody was telling me, I know somebody who lives back there, I have always questioned the quality of construction"
SWBD-331,"A: and I guess I would like, I don't know, the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a crime problem either. B: Oh, really. A: No, you can't, they don't execute anybody in Britain or France"
SWBD-332,"B: You know, back around, you know, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, uh, you know, they were all located together, in one small community. A: Right, right.  Right. B: And I mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth. And now when they come together it's generally, you know, like say the kids of those people who are not, you know, anywhere near one another"
SWBD-333,A: it was so fattening. B: That sounds good. A:
SWBD-334,"A: Uh-huh. Yeah, but on the other hand, you know, if they would have had a hard time retaliating because you know, they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes. B: I see. A: through, you know, two enemies. B:"
SWBD-335,"B: Uh, that's, came out around the first of the year. A: Okay, okay. Because I had done capital packages for two eighty-sixes and three eighty-sixes,"
SWBD-336,"A: it could still happen then. B: Yeah, that's true, but you'd be surprised also how, much people watch you that even not, uh, participating in any type crime. I guess there was one case, I was surprised, uh, so happened this person worked at the same place, I work for Georgia Tech and they work at the same place I did,"
SWBD-337,"B: Yeah. That's what I was going to say. It's the chicken and the egg thing. I wonder, I mean, a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools vandalism wise, A: Right. B: and you get, I mean, it's been a while since I been in high school. They're even in grade school when they do that. But I can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that."
SWBD-338,"A: Uh, well, that gets. Some of the punk, um, when I was in high school, that was, uh, one of the big things, was punk music, and, uh, or some of it has a lot to say, the lyrics do, but the actual, B:"
SWBD-339,"A: The flavor is better I think in between. B: Oh, in between the size wise yeah, A: Yes, yeah. B: yeah. A: Uh-huh. My mother, B:"
SWBD-34,"A: Um, my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen just what went into the something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers. B: Uh-huh. A: I guess in some cases they just consider pickup your phone and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not. B: Uh-huh. A:"
SWBD-340,"B: And the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey. Not everybody can play hockey. A: Yeah. B: So we, and that's, we're a big hockey area up here, I bet up here in New England as well as, you know, in the Minnesota area A: Really. B: but, A:"
SWBD-341,"A: Well, church softball leagues, so, B: Uh-huh. A: they're not all boys and right now we don't have a girls' league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one and I just haven't gotten around to doing it. I keep saying we need to have one. They go, okay, then start one. But everybody wants to do it but, you know, God's sitting on my heart and I just hadn't gotten around to doing it, so they could really only have four members on the team. I think they only have four boys."
SWBD-342,"A: but that is one of my solutions. Uh... B: I know here in Dallas that they have just instituted in the last couple of years, uh, a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections."
SWBD-343,"A: Because they're, I guess that falls, and one of my other favorite shows is Sesame Street because of the kids. I like that real well. B: Right, well, when my kids were little, I did have a TV set and I did watch a lot of Sesame Street and a lot of Electric Company, as well. A:"
SWBD-344,"B: Uh, my son's teacher has twenty-seven students. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis. Uh A: Yeah.  Perhaps. B:"
SWBD-345,"A: They, probably not enough, but I'm sure I lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind, of what they're missing out on. B: Yeah, I think they're starting to realize,"
SWBD-346,"A: And I think that, it's one thing to, uh, voluntarily give it because someone asks. You can always refuse but it's another thing where it's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody. You know, B: Right. Uh, That, A:"
SWBD-347,"B: And you know, we had all the necessities, so. And I very seldom use a credit card on necessities. I always use it for something I want not something I need. A: Exactly. B: So, A: Yeah, my parents are really good about not using credit cards. They are against it. B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-348,"A: But, I'm not real sure that we promised them anything. B: Uh-huh. A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-349,"B: And, uh, I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also. A: That's re-, yeah. B:"
SWBD-35,"B: I look at our big green containers, and I say, well, they work fine and I keep mine outside the garage so that I don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where, uh, uh, A: Oh, right. B: it will be interesting to see how well that works and I'm glad the community is doing it. Uh, it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people. Uh, I don't know what you saw back, uh, years ago,"
SWBD-350,"B: And so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation. And, of course, that's when he said well you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's, you render unto God what is God's. A: Right. B: And, uh, you know, of course, there,"
SWBD-351,A: Your turn. B: Okay.
SWBD-352,"B: And they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before. A: Uh-huh. B: And, you know, that's about the only thing."
SWBD-353,"A: Do you think they should spend more? B: Uh, I think they should, actually, although perhaps not an incredible amount more than what they're doing,"
SWBD-354,"A: Oh, wow! But maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. B: So,  I know. A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on"
SWBD-355,"B: I wish they'd put those, that's why I say, did you stay up late to watch this Red Dwarf. It came on after Doctor Who, on Saturday nights, here at least. A: Uh-huh. B: And it should, of course I li- really it was,"
SWBD-356,"B: Oh, I do too. A: So anyway it's still, B: Uh-huh, uh-huh. "
SWBD-357,"B: Uh, I have, uh, I guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War, um, I guess I feel like I was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things I remember and a lot of things that I really didn't have a clue as to what was happening. B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives. That was one of the questions that she asked us to think about, because we never went to war."
SWBD-358,"B: I'm sorry. B: Well, I'm in Texas. I just assumed that I had, this is the first call I've done, A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-359,"B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored. You know, they will allow you to, I can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-36,"B: That's right, it's all their fault. A: Well, I mean, it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they saw the light, um, I don't know why they um, were more able than we were"
SWBD-360,"B: And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus. It's a really nice car. I think, it's a stylish car both inside and out. It's comfortable to drive. Uh, reasonable performance, and this is out in California where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore. A: Yeah. B: Uh, I've been real impressed with that. Yo-,"
SWBD-361,"A: I, that would have been stupid, B: Yeah. A: and I don't think we did it. Everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right."
SWBD-362,"A: I really don't. But no, when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, because I have been raised in one, you know, so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-363,"A: Right or wrong? B: Uh, okay, right or wrong, I don't think we can determine whether we were right or wrong, because, you're having to deal with, again, uh, I think we could have made a different agreement back in the late forties era that would have kept of there. A: Uh-huh. "
SWBD-364,"A: Really. If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic, you know, intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might. B: Yeah. A: I believe in paying my share, and I don't mind, uh, paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to. But I just sometimes feel like I'm being used."
SWBD-365,"B: And as far as like them, uh, entertaining the rights that they should have. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, we educate them, we feed them, we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-366,"A: Yeah, huh-uh, and especially not in some of these big cities, like in Dallas I mean they've had, they're up in the top five I think of cities that are getting policeman killed in the line of duty and that's really sad. B: it really is. And I mean, they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-367,"A: Yeah, you're probably right, two years might be a little too long. B: Yeah, and there will be a lot of rebellion in that"
SWBD-368,A: How did Radio Shack work? B: If you go in and buy anything they want your phone number.
SWBD-369,"A: Right. And, see that's my only problem with, uh, making you, um, you know, get the check and everything is, I guess bad guys, if you want to call them bad guys, they are going to get a gun no matter what. B: Uh-huh. A: They're not,"
SWBD-37,"A: Yes, um, I think that Plano has really done a fantastic job. I mean, at least their plans are good. Um, however, I was,"
SWBD-370,"B: But, I do n't get into uh, the real women libber movement, you know. A: No, I do n't either."
SWBD-371,B: That's it. A: And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything. B: Uh-huh.
SWBD-372,"B: So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there? A:"
SWBD-373,"A: I do too. I believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time, but I don't, I believe that they're better now, you know, wh-, B: I think so."
SWBD-376,"B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good."
SWBD-377,"B: uh, what kind of camping do they like best? Do they like it where they have tents and, uh, do they cook on stoves? A: Um, yes, they've, well, no, actually I remember, they have taken the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire,"
SWBD-378,"A: Well I hadn't either, B: Yeah. A: We hadn't, you know, like I said, we,"
SWBD-379,"A: but, it was interesting to, I don't know if they're making them better or not, it's hard to say. I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier, but I think the technology is better. B: I think technology is better, I'm not sure. I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that. A: About quality. B:"
SWBD-38,"B: That's right. A: Well, that's fun. So, um, let's see, uh, some of the things we do together as a family, we like to play games a lot,"
SWBD-380,"B: Well, the world changes, so I mean, obviously, kids are not the same now as they used to be. A: Right. B: I mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things. They have a whole lot more, uh, variety of things that they see and do at an earlier age, so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time, but still, I think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to teach, uh, basic values and basic, uh, respectful uh, -ness of authority. A: Right. B:"
SWBD-381,"A: Good morning. Um, I mean, if I start this I just wanted to say that, um, one of the things that I don't think we really understood about the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are, and I mean they think differently and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours. and right now, I think that that's been proven in the fact that, um, they have just, well, anyway, I just think that, you know, the United States policy over there, I think we should just leave them alone. I really do. in a major way because um, that whole region over there, I think needs to settle its own differences within itself. B: Yeah. A: And that's the course that they should go, I mean, you know, we can maybe help them a little bit, prompt them,"
SWBD-382,"B: and, you know, they just love kittens. A: Yeah. B: They just are fascinated. A: Oh, yeah. B:"
SWBD-383,"A: Yeah, but, uh, I guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty, uh, innocuous. Although, uh, from what I hear in the news, and I saw an episode of the TV show, COPS uh, one time that was in Pittsburgh, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, it did surprise me, because, you know, they were doing drug arrests and things like that,"
SWBD-384,"B: Oh, you are in New York right now? A: Yeah. B: Oh. I'm in Texas."
SWBD-385,B: And it's just too bad that we couldn't see that. A: I just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet. That I still feel like there's more to come.
SWBD-386,"A: People are always mo-, you know, one out of every seven people moves every year. Uh, that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: if you compound that, uh, eh- eh, if it is difficult to register to vote, that would remove your eligibility to vote. B:"
SWBD-387,"B: and at that point, the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned, and, we were there like in the middle of the summer, it's unair-conditioned, it was dusty and dirty, uh, there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it. And so, we didn't really know we weren't supposed to, we thought TI dress code was just dress appropriate to your job, A: Uh-huh. B: we wore shorts."
SWBD-388,"A: Because, I know that now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles. B: Uh-huh, uh-huh. A: And the only, uh, branch in the armed services that seems willing to do that is the Air Force. And, uh, I spoke because women were flying missions uh, in the Persian Gulf war. B: Huh.  Yeah, yeah. A:"
SWBD-389,"A: It was just a side benefit. B: Yeah, yeah, because, I'm not big or anything, but I'm not in great shape, But when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape. I didn't build up muscle, though, I just got real good and toned. A: Yeah. B:"
SWBD-39,"A: That's good. They say, B: And they get along real good."
SWBD-390,"A: and, they seem pretty, you know, they don't have the hard body. They don't have that perfect look, and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious. But you know, they live to a hundred and ten some, you know, B: Yeah, A: And, that's, B:"
SWBD-391,"B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right. "
SWBD-392,"B: and the new cars is, hardly anything. A: Yeah, they're better, but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there. Uh, when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or, uh, B: Yeah,"
SWBD-393,"A: that's the whole point. There are so many games in a year that they've got to have repeat customers. B: Yeah. A: They can't afford not to, and, you know, that's one of the things that I think Saint Louis has done, um, I mean, you know, their ticket prices are, you know, I guess as high as anybody else's but somehow or another they, attract, uh, so many people from, I mean it's a small market and yet they attract as many if not more than uh, uh, most, other cities, so. B: Yeah,"
SWBD-394,"A: I do too, so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers, B: Huh-uh. A: but oh, her books are just incredible."
SWBD-395,"A: and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time. B: Right. Well, do you think that should be implemented in the work place"
SWBD-396,"B: Right. And I'm sure that would make a big difference, too. You know, you've got, A: Yeah. Well, what about a voluntary program?"
SWBD-397,"B: I can understand that very easily. I've had a class on, um, R Base and also in Paradox A: Uh-huh. B: and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base. A: Uh-huh."
SWBD-398,"B: You know, how can you help depending on the day care center, you know, A: Yeah. B: you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers,"
SWBD-399,"A: It's no more costly than renting one. The last, see I went about two or three weeks ago and saw FX TWO and that is a really good movie, if you like special effects, kind of gory and lots of, you know action. B: Uh-huh.  I have not done that one, I don't know if I have even heard of that one. A:"
SWBD-4,"B: So again, it never really penalizes, the company doing the wrong. A: Right. That will, B: They can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to. A: Huh. B:"
SWBD-40,"A: And you also get a lot of, uh, juries are extremely, uh, and from what I hear, I have some friends who do expert witness testimony and they say that, uh, juries are extremely vulnerable to, uh, sort of emotional pitches, you know, the prosecutor will want to, oh, I don't know show the mugging victim, you know, show the nice person he was and what a family life, and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim, or, uh, if it's a corporation, that was, uh, you know, harming some individual or something like that, they get very much, well, you know, it's just a big faceless corporation. let's make them pay as much as possible. Things like that. B: Uh-huh. A: So, not, I mean, I'm,"
SWBD-400,"A: Now the best, the supporting actor, he was good, but from what I heard, the guy who got it was better, so you know, I can see that. B: Yeah. A: But, oh, B:"
SWBD-401,"A: in a lot of parts, yeah. I know Texas is supposed to be flat, but you know, down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of, uh, B: Uh-huh.  Sherman and Denison,"
SWBD-402,"A: Um, yeah, I guess that's not an easy solution. there's no easy solution for that. B: Uh-huh.  I don't know that there is an easy solution, but if you could find a way to prevent some of it, and I'm not sure what it would be. It would be money better spent than, A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-403,"B: And also I just think it gets a lot, I'm a big, uh, supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies, and I think that it just moves down along a line that I really would find bad if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work, you know, there's already talk of people, well, we're not going to hire you if you smoke. Well, you know, I can see how they can say in the work place you don't want them to smoke, but when somebody leaves work, I don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all. A:"
SWBD-404,"B: and, um, it makes a difference, I, and just the social values, A: Well, I've just,"
SWBD-405,"B: So am I. A: Are you, B:"
SWBD-406,"B: the Arabs all of a sudden uh, are cheering for Baker on his drive to reconcile relations with the Israelis, so it's like, A: Well, Baker is really not very much pro Israel. B: Yeah I, A:"
SWBD-408,"B: how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of acid rain. A: Right.  Right. B: It's, uh, really a serious issue for those of us up in this, uh, sector up here. A:"
SWBD-409,"B: I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers for less pollutant vehicles. A: Yeah,  Yeah, I think you need a vehicle something like, uh, Ralph Nader, Nader's Raiders, uh, or, uh, uh,   R P, which has a lot of members. Uh, if you can get those types of groups. B: Yeah.  Uh-huh. "
SWBD-41,"B: I think for serial murder it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold blood, A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Needs to be punished or, uh, eliminated from society. B:"
SWBD-410,"B: Um, gee, I don't, I mean, I guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust, you know, they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that. A: Right. B: So, I believe them but I'm not a chemist. A:"
SWBD-411,A: Okay. B: Okay.
SWBD-412,"A: Well what did you think of Reagan as a president? B: I just thought he was really inept. I don't think he did anything at all. they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were, A:"
SWBD-413,"A: Well I spent three years in Germany, so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway. A: But I got used to it, it was really strange, I mean, when we came to San Antonio it was just swelter and then we got used to it and then we went up to Dallas and it was just, it's not that it's just hot or dry, it's just not very comfortable, it just, B: Her-,"
SWBD-414,"A: Boy that really takes someone who is bold to do that. B: Well, yeah, it's pretty bad. A:"
SWBD-415,"B: is that good? You know, I've seen that so many times, strawberries dipped in chocolate but I've never tried it, are they really good? A: Yeah, you know, if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better, but if you get a sour strawberry, B:"
SWBD-416,"B: All right, well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right. "
SWBD-417,"B: No, not really. Uh, the only thing that annoys me is when, uh, people call and uh, you have solicitation calls. A: Uh-huh. B: That's the only thing that bothers me. That's not really invading my privacy. A: Right. B:"
SWBD-418,"B: Oh, yeah, it's been beautiful this last week but, A: I could do with a little less wind, but I think the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside. B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-419,"B: I think that probably was the difference in that game. A: Uh-huh. B: Because it really could have gone either way. Down to the end, you know. A:"
SWBD-42,"A: I thought Carter was good too, and that was, yeah, B: Did you? I always liked him, I thought he was great at the time and I just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him."
SWBD-420,"A: I do not have one in my home. I use one all day at work, but I don't have one at home. B: Do you wish you,"
SWBD-421,"A: Well I, uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now. B: Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation the next one was when I graduated from college, so I guess about two more years. A: Yes, well,"
SWBD-422,"B: it's also a way of relieving stress. My wife kind of laughs, at me that anytime I get stressed out I just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves. A: Well, I'll have to come and see them. That sounds like a good idea. I, you know, and that is right, it is out of necessity because lot of the things uh, well, we can't be able to afford, but also I sometimes think that, uh, I enjoy doing that and I like to get out and, uh, to work with my hands and, uh, sounds like you got some real nice tools, too."
SWBD-423,"B: Yeah, it's called VCX or something like that. Also called Delta Clipper, which is a decent name for something like that. A: Wow.  Well, I don't know."
SWBD-424,"B: Yeah, it isn't, there is not much out there that is fair, that's for sure. A: Right. B: Huh. I will agree to that. A:"
SWBD-425,"B: Mile a Minute. A: Well, I'm not sure what she does I, first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across, you know, back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of afghan."
SWBD-426,"B: Oh, I see. So, do you... A: and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time. B: Right."
SWBD-427,"B: Right. And the parents fund them for the whole year and a half that they're gone. A: uh, it's interesting. It gets them away from home and gets them to do something useful, although the kids today, though, it seems almost that their concern for money, we were doing some investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in trying to find a job, study something that will give them a job as opposed to, be curious as to if, if there was mandatory, you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary,"
SWBD-428,"A: Uh, I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring. B: Well, I'm sure with the new, uh, contract awarding"
SWBD-429,"A: I haven't really noticed them doing that, but whatever, again I don't watch TV news that much now. If I had access to CNN, I would watch TV news more. Uh, you know, but I don't usually. B: Yeah, I don't have access either. Although, I did at one time and it was, I did during the Gulf War and it was addictive. A: Yeah."
SWBD-43,"A: Sure. Oh, great. That is wonderful. B: So, A: Yeah. Well, Dallas, uh, we lived in Minneapolis. Uh, we moved here about ten months ago. And Dallas is pretty, uh, well, we live in north Dallas which is near a suburb called Plano. So we are out of the city, but uh, it is bad everywhere in terms of, uh, you know, the handgun situation, um, the number of rapes, the number of muggings."
SWBD-430,"A: And, uh, I don't know, it leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that. In other words, they just prioritize their lives differently. But I think that has a lot to do with economic situation. B: Yes. What about like as far as, uh, social changes in the individual?"
SWBD-431,"B: And, uh, granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged, you know. A: Well, how do you feel about setting, like, well, for example, uh, or some incident where someone loses a limb. "
SWBD-432,"A: That most of it is plea bargained, uh, half way through or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway. B: Right. A: But, uh, uh, how do you feel uh, about the jury system itself?"
SWBD-433,"A: In Richardson, we're in Plano here. B: Oh, okay. A: I have a daughter in middle school, and, uh, I know there aren't very many, she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home,"
SWBD-434,"B: I think that probably was the difference in that game. A: Uh-huh. B: Because it really could have gone either way. Down to the end, you know. A:"
SWBD-435,"B: That's right. Well, even if it's not technical. If it's, uh, some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter. If I am an expert in it, they usually make mistakes which makes me think I'm not expert in it. They're telling me lies. A: Yeah. Yeah. by mistakes, do you mean just like honest mistakes"
SWBD-436,B: and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base. A: Uh-huh. Do you think D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more.
SWBD-437,"B: But I think with the way the future is, um, economy wise, I don't think it's going to be realistic. A: I know. Unfortunately, that's probably true."
SWBD-438,"A: And, let's see, twenty years ago, I guess we were just beginning to get into what they were calling uh, the sex revolution uh after the pill B: Yeah. A: and, uh, uh, freed people up from worries about, uh, illegitimate pregnancy and, I guess in the seventies is the time when that was supposed to have exploded. Thirty years ago there was no pill. B: Uh-huh."
SWBD-439,"B: although in my case I might have been more, uh, sympathetic with the person who got caught, I don't know. A: Uh-huh.  So, uh, were the, uh, sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair, or would,"
SWBD-44,"B: the best of every type of music. A: Right. B: Because, I mean, there are some, I mean, I li-, there are some, you know, types of heavy metal that I really like,"
SWBD-440,"A: Go ahead. B: Okay,"
SWBD-441,"B: Yeah, I think that, um, in the future, um, the family unit as it once was known, is going to be nonexistent. what do you think? A: About? B: That as far as do you think there's going to be still a family unit"
SWBD-442,"A: Then that would, yeah. B: it will bother me. A:"
SWBD-443,"B: I've driven through it several times. Uh, we skied California a bunch when we lived out there, uh, um, and, of course, we grew up in Minnesota, A: Uh-huh. B: and we do lot of cross country skiing there. A: Oh, yeah,.  Yeah, great."
SWBD-444,"B: Okay. Uh, generally I get, uh, you know, most of my news, uh, in the, you know, weekly magazines like TIME, Newsweek and, uh, US News and World Report. with occasional smatterings of, uh, you know, THE Wall Street Journal and, of course, the local paper. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, my only complaint is I really don't enough time to look at the articles every day and go through a paper, you know, exhaust the details. So that's why I concentrate on weekly magazines. B:"
SWBD-445,A: I think there really is. B: It's kind of an easy thing to talk about. A:
SWBD-446,"B: it is a lot of repeat crime. And you are like, why are they repeating? They should have been in there longer. Or, A: I know. And then you think, I mean, I mean, I can remember, I have not been out of school that long, but it has been at least ten years. And you think to yourself, was it that bad back then? Or is it just, I think that, like you said, television?"
SWBD-447,"B: Uh-huh. So, yeah, that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you. A: Uh-huh. Of course we have a slight problem in that, uh, the number of the illiterate in America is mushrooming at this point, and, uh, you know, where our kids might be in a great school, we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B:"
SWBD-448,"B: Yeah, I think that, um, in the future, um, the family unit as it once was known, is going to be nonexistent. what do you think? A: About? B: That as far as"
SWBD-449,"A: Oh, okay. uh, you ready to begin? B: We might as well. A: Oh, okay. Okay. B:"
SWBD-45,"A: Well, uh, it seems to me uh, that I do not know whether the jury system, uh,"
SWBD-450,"B: And yet, uh, I we-, I hope to see employer based, you know, helping out. You know, child, uh, care centers at the place of employment and things like that, that will help out. A: Uh-huh. B: What do you think,"
SWBD-451,"A: that's one difference. There really wasn't a lot of difference. B: I didn't, see I never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie. That's interesting. That was a good movie, too. A:"
SWBD-452,"A: So, we're comparable. B: Yeah. A: As a matter of fact, I just paid my Richardson taxes because I live in Richardson and supplemented the Robin Hoods very thoroughly, I think. B: Yeah,"
SWBD-453,"B: Yeah, that's probably true. You know A: But, I think that's a small, uh, number could, B:"
SWBD-454,"B: But, then, you know, I think that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. You know, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them A: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Right, uh-huh. B: and I don't think, that would really warrant capital punishment. A: Uh-huh,"
SWBD-455,"A: But, you know, I think that, um, we chose to have our official feelings hurt. B: Uh-huh. A: Where a lot w-, B:"
SWBD-456,"A: Sometimes you hear things on the radio that, you know, could be true or couldn't be. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, do you feel like this is, I guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research. B: Uh-huh. A:"
SWBD-457,"B: when you've lost something or uh, uh, don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize, you know, what's out there and you know, what you have and what you don't have. A: Yeah I agree. B: So the original question,"
SWBD-458,"A: And now, uh, it's pretty much an economic necessity in most places for both parents to work. B: Do you think it's an economic necessity"
SWBD-459,"B: Oh, boy. He is tough, he has an incredible leg. A: He is.  Yes. B:"
SWBD-46,"A: It's depressing. B: Uh-huh, it is, and you know, you don't spi-, well. Speaking for myself I don't sleep as well, when I am not exercising, and uh, it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff, your body just gets used to it. Yeah, I don't particularly enjoy it. Well I used to lift weights an awful lot, and stuff like that. I do enjoy riding bike,"
SWBD-460,"A: And I haven't quite figured that out, if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing. They say, hey, we got to do something now. And then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes. B: Yeah. A: So, I don't know I'm looking for a good year. I guess we're always looking for a good year. B:"
SWBD-461,"A: Well, I don't know, uh, I have a hard time getting, uh, people on the telephone. B: Oh really. A: Uh-huh, getting through to anybody. Sometimes I call off and on all day, B: Huh. A:"
SWBD-462,"B: So I've never really cared. Now, what I was, you know, before I was married and before I went to graduate school, I used to do little sports car racing. it was never my own car A: Uh-huh. B: it was always someone else's. And that sort of thing I enjoy, but to go out and drive, uh, never has really had any appeal to me in that regard. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-463,"B: uh, but it's worked out for my family, to have my cake and eat it too, kind of thing. A: Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good deal. Where do you think this is going in the future,"
SWBD-464,"A: Okay. You know our family right now, uh, the most of it, there is only a few stragglers, uh, with any distance. There is one cousin out in Colorado, uh, uh, some cousins over in Phoenix, uh, I got a sister over in, uh, Washington State. Uh, the rest of them are within, you know, a couple hours drive. B: Well, uh, how do you all communicate? Like to plan it and every thing."
SWBD-465,"B: Uh, yes. It's about why there aren't more people that are voting and participating in... A: And what is your feeling?"
SWBD-466,"A: Yeah, thirty years ago I had a college job, uh, working as a programmer and we had to write code in binary and, uh, have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which, I don't think exists anymore. B: I know.  No. A: You never see one of those punch cards anymore. B:"
SWBD-467,"A: Yeah. The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes. The stations I listen to are just mainly music. B: Yeah, I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all. A: Yeah."
SWBD-468,"A: No, not really. I spends a lot of time with our income tax, though. especially, this year and last year. Um, I have been married for just a few years, so I've had to really switch around from the EZ form to the, uh, B: Schedule A. A: Right. B: Well, yeah. A: All the deductions and all that. B:"
SWBD-469,"B: Well, if you're from Iowa, you must be very artsy crafty. Everyone I've ever known from the Midwest can do everything with their hands. A: Oh, well, actually I'm from California and before then I was from Utah. So. B:"
SWBD-47,"A: uh I picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive B: Uh-huh. A: and so I do have a band saw and a router and, uh, things like that out in the garage."
SWBD-470,"A: Yeah, it's interesting because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and they'll say, oh, well, my kid, I've never heard anything about this before. This is the first time there have been problems."
SWBD-48,"A: Right, they don't want anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system. B: Exactly.  Uh-huh, exactly. Uh, A: And they tend, and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it, I mean, you know, it's anyone can get out of jury just about, uh, so, uh, it's not really my peers that, let's say I were arrested falsely or not and put up for a jury"
SWBD-49,"A: Uh-huh. Yeah, my wife's from the western part of Virginia, we've been down the parkway a lot, but I didn't know how much camping areas there were along there. B: I think there's quite a few."
SWBD-50,"B: Yeah, it is. A: For instance, B: I'm a historian, and my father had kept them, I think, since nineteen twenty-seven uh, but he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi-, A: My goodness. B:"
SWBD-51,"B: And they may have some different idea, I mean, it might be more important for them to put a sentencing down that was, uh, longer, you know, that the punishment didn't fit the crime. Or not long enough or, you know, whatever the case may be. A: Uh-huh.  Yeah. B: I think the judges do have that better knowledge of it. The only thing I worry about sometimes is if you get somebody in there that has a name, that is the defendant and, you know, sometimes, might have more pull, which does happen. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-52,"A: I mean, it looked darker to him, because he was in the house with the lights on. B: Right. A: When I was out walking, it, was more of a predawn type, pretty, but, huh-huh,"
SWBD-53,"A: That's the other thing. I mean a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. B: Yeah. There's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult A: Yeah. B:"
SWBD-54,B: not going to help. It's never helped my personal situation.
SWBD-55,"B: What you want. where do they get it?. A: Well, I don't know, I guess they don't have it at home, B:"
SWBD-56,"B: so there's only been really one working. A: Uh-huh, same here. Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it works for me"
SWBD-57,"A: they can be selective, right. B: And they, that's right, they have the ability to be selective."
SWBD-58,"B: it would get snatched right off your arm. A: that's true. But I was thinking boy, in Dallas, if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night, I'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out. B: Oh sure. A:"
SWBD-59,"A: And that didn't help at all? B: No, I don't, the crime is not any better or any worse, I mean it's, A: Huh. B:"
SWBD-6,"B: you know, sometimes I would go over, but you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big way because I knew that, uh, I would have it covered in that respect. A: Right.  Right. That's good. I don't think we've gone that far, to pay it you know, in advance before we spend it, "
SWBD-60,"B: Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess. They don't really, has kind of the same sound over and over, and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are A: Um. Right. B: you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too. A: Yeah."
SWBD-61,"A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A:"
SWBD-62,"A: Yeah. Wouldn't that be awful if you were using, and oh, lose your job and everything. B: Which I thought was interesting.  Oh, man, yeah.  Ooh, yeah. A:"
SWBD-64,"B: That's right, and then they, uh, poof it off, you know, do like Tarpley. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, I"
SWBD-65,"A: Yes, yes it is. Down in the more southern and western areas. And, of course we are, um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south, B: Yeah. A: and, uh, very windy."
SWBD-66,"B: But, uh, A: Yeah, well, you know, the call for help is what scares me now because it just, I don't know, people just don't, I don't know,"
SWBD-67,"B: Yeah. I understood that. you know, I work full time and I have two kids so my spare time usually involves something with the kids. A: Yeah. B: You know, hobbies,"
SWBD-68,"A: But, no it would seem like it would be the same way on the California coastline, wouldn't it? B: Oh, gosh, I think I would hate to live in California, the smog there. A: Uh-huh. B:"
SWBD-69,"B: No, it was, I didn't like the way it ended. A: I know, well the only reason I know why it ended is on Arsenio Hall one night, Christopher Reeves told, that, you know, B: Uh-huh. A:"
SWBD-7,"A: you can't get all of us. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, and we're beginning to see more and more of that. B:"
SWBD-70,"B: Yeah. Those are pretty. A: Number one turned out just great,"
SWBD-71,"B: Uh-huh, exactly, not what color you are, how old you are, what you're male or female. That would be wonderful, I guess it's kind of an ideal world though, huh. A: Yeah, I kind of think, maybe in time, that, you know, you'll go by social security numbers, you know, B: Yeah. A:"
SWBD-72,"B: So it's A: Yeah. B: definitely but, uh, I don't know."
SWBD-73,"A: So you know, and I think it would be very difficult to uh, find a panel that would not have seen it and known of what was going on. B: Oh, I agree with you"
SWBD-74,"B: But I know some people can get, you know, carried away with them and let them get out of hand. A: Uh-huh.  It's really easy, just to forget, you know, that you charged that or charged that. I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill's going to come, but sometimes I forget and so, you know, a bill will come in"
SWBD-75,"A: That is the reason, I don't play over there. B: Yeah. A: I like the course, but I don't play over there because, they don't, uh, you know don't allow you to pull a cart. B: Right. A:"
SWBD-76,"B: Yeah. they own you or, you know, grant you with you their presence, you know. A: Yeah, right.  Yeah. Right. That, yes, we're supposed to appreciate them. Well, uh, when I come home in the evenings, my dog greets me at the door."
SWBD-77,"A: Okay. Uh, one of the things they talked about was, uh, what do we think about a judge making the decision? B: Uh-huh. A: And I really don't agree with that. I think that the trial by jury is better, uh, you know, having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible."
SWBD-78,"B: I do not know. I wonder where he gets it? You know, you must, I think TV is bad. Because they, uh, show all sorts of violence on, A: That and I do not think a lot of parents, I mean, I do not know how it is in the Air Force base. But, uh, I just do not think a lot of people, because of the economy, both need to work, you know."
SWBD-79,"A: Highland Park's thinking about going that route. B: Uh-huh. A: So it, and then I think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do. B: Yeah,"
SWBD-8,"B: Yeah, but I'm not sure how successful that is. A: Well, I think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner, if there weren't so many appeals. B: Quicker maybe,  yeah. A: Yeah,"
SWBD-80,"A: Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting, I've even gone so far as to put that, I've got a storm door on the front of the house and I've put, in, I don't know how much clearer it can be, it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting. I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise, cause I still get, B: Yeah, yeah, that's true, yeah. No I didn't go that far but, uh, yeah I probably could do the same thing, uh, you know, I don't have a storm door, but I'm sure I could rig up something."
SWBD-81,"A: Do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm, a dollar figure for losing different body parts? B: I don't know. You know some of the health insurance is written that way. You know, that, uh, if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy, you know, it s-, pre specified in the policy so much"
SWBD-82,"B: No, I always vote. A: Well, I have absentee voted in, uh, New Hampshire, and it is a fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot. B: Oh, really. A:"
SWBD-83,A: That's true. B: And they're going to be really struggling
SWBD-84,"B: But I like dogs and my husband likes cats. So we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet. If we get a place where we can have both, it'll be great, but until then, A: Yeah, I like both,"
SWBD-85,"A: I mean, I guess, uh, out of all the movies, I've never been as excited to go back. I was ready to go back and see it again, you know B: Really. Yeah, yeah, you're right about that, but that's really like an all time classic."
SWBD-86,"A: Okay. Well, let's see, well, we keep our paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and, uh, plastics and, uh, we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full. I guess we collect milk cartons and whatever other plastics are acceptable. B: Are you in the part of town where, uh, they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling? A: No, no,"
SWBD-87,"B: he refuted it, it just was not effective enough to... A: Well, he didn't refute it til the last two weeks of the campaign. He didn't believe anybody would believe that. And indeed his trend started upward. B:"
SWBD-88,"B: So, she tried to enter her number and it wouldn't work so she said, whew, it's for you. But, uh, you know, I don't know, I struggle with it,"
SWBD-89,"A: Yeah, I think that's what aggravates a lot of people, is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty, and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months.. B: Uh-huh. Yeah, it's just our criminal system is just so, I guess, overloaded, but the problem is not so much with the prison system, you know, I mean, because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws, and the prison system are just, you know, they're trying to cope with them, but, you know, the thing about capital punishment I, you know,"
SWBD-9,"A: uh, you can do that which is what I choose to do. B: Yeah. One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited A: Yeah. B:"
SWBD-90,"A: No, it doesn't. B: And, of course, your court system when you get into the appeals,"
SWBD-91,"A: You know, once it rains a little bit, it's filled up and everything else just runs off, B: Uh-huh. A: you know. B: Yeah. San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come. it's a complete mess, everything floods, all the under passes. A: Yeah. B:"
SWBD-92,"A: The last one I saw was Dances With The Wolves. B: Yeah, we talked about that one too."
SWBD-93,"A: I mean I've never seen them do it without hose, I mean they always have hose on, but still, they're shorts, I don't care what you say, they're shorts. B: Well I think TI's dress code is pretty lax considering everything, anyway, you know, uh. A:"
SWBD-94,"B: And she got kind of fearful of being on her own. She never really ate very well. It was one thing. She hardly ever took care of herself A: Yeah. B: and she didn't eat. She ate very poor so I think she was, you know, bad, uh, nutrition on top of it. And, uh, she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore. So, A:"
SWBD-95,"A: That's okay. B: Uh, yeah, this is, the, uh, mutual defense thing was, uh, we, it was complicated,"
SWBD-96,"A: I mean, that's some-, and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers, B: That's wrong. A: Yeah, gosh, I mean, B:"
SWBD-97,"A: or you know, it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference. B: Uh-huh. It, I mean, I don't know,"
SWBD-98,"B: Well, I was never there for any sentencing. Uh, I finally got empaneled on one case, uh, on my next to the last day, and, uh, we got into the, uh, jury room to, uh, decide the case, and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate, because he'd already decided that the guy was, uh, not guilty, and he would never vote for guilty.
